◆ CHAPTER 1 | RIGIDITY TO AGILITY

▪ As we travel through our lives, we humans have few ways of knowing which course to take or what lies ahead. We don’t have lighthouses to keep us away from rocky relationships. We don’t have lookouts on the bow or radar on the tower, watching for submerged threats that could sink our career plans.

▪ Instead, we have our emotions—sensations like fear, anxiety, joy, and exhilaration—a neurochemical system that evolved to help us navigate life’s complex currents.

▪ Emotions, from blinding rage to wide-eyed love, are the body’s immediate physical responses to important signals from the outside world.

▪ As with Seaman O’Reilly’s lighthouse, our natural guidance system, which developed through evolutionary trial and error over millions of years, is a great deal more useful when we don’t try to fight it. But that’s not always easy to do, because our emotions are not always reliable. In some situations, they help us cut through pretenses and posturing, working as a kind of internal radar to give us the most accurate and insightful read into what’s really going on in a situation.

▪ But in other situations, emotions dredge up old business, confusing our perception of what’s happening in the moment with painful past experiences.

▪ Of course, most adults rarely surrender control to their emotions with inappropriate public displays that take years to live down. More likely, you’ll trip yourself up in a less theatrical but more insidious fashion.

▪ Many people, much of the time, operate on emotional autopilot, reacting to situations without true awareness or even real volition. Others are acutely aware that they expend too much energy trying to contain or suppress their emotions, treating them at best like unruly children and at worst as threats to their well-being. Still others feel their emotions are stopping them from achieving the kind of life they want, especially when it comes to those feelings that we find troublesome, such as anger, shame, and anxiety.

▪ In time, our responses to signals from the real world can become increasingly faint and unnatural, leading us off course instead of protecting our best interests.

▪ With this book, my goal is to help you become more aware of your emotions, learn to accept and make peace with them, and then flourish by increasing your emotional agility.

▪ Striving to be perfect—or always perfectly happy—will only set you up for frustration and failure.

▪ The “agility” part addresses your thinking and behavior processes as well—those habits of mind and body that can also prevent you from flourishing, especially when, like the captain of the battleship Defiant, you react in the same old obstinate way to new or different situations.

▪ Rigidity may come from the perfectly normal habit of taking mental shortcuts and accepting presumptions and rules of thumb that may have served you once—in childhood, in a first marriage, at an earlier point in your career—but aren’t serving you now: “People can’t be trusted.” “I’m going to get hurt.”

▪ Meanwhile, emotional agility—being flexible with your thoughts and feelings so that you can respond optimally to everyday situations—is key to well-being and success.

▪ And yet emotional agility is not about controlling your thoughts or forcing yourself into thinking more positively. Because research also shows that trying to get people to change their thoughts from, say, the negative (“I’m going to screw up this presentation”) to the positive (“You’ll see—I’ll ace it”), usually doesn’t work, and can actually be counterproductive.

▪ Emotional agility is about loosening up, calming down, and living with more intention. It’s about choosing how you’ll respond to your emotional warning system.

▪ “Between stimulus and response there is a space,” he wrote. “In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”

▪ By opening up that space between how you feel and what you do about those feelings, emotional agility has been shown to help people with any number of troubles: negative self-image, heartbreak, pain, anxiety, depression, procrastination, tough transitions, etc.

▪ It also draws on diverse disciplines in psychology that explore the characteristics of successful, thriving people, including those like Frankl, who survived great hardship and went on to do great things.

▪ Emotionally agile people are dynamic.

▪ They demonstrate flexibility in dealing with our fast-changing, complex world. They are able to tolerate high levels of stress and to endure setbacks, while remaining engaged, open, and receptive. They understand that life isn’t always easy, but they continue to act according to their most cherished values and pursue their big, long-term goals. They still experience feelings of anger, sadness, and so on—who doesn’t?—but they face these with curiosity, self-compassion, and acceptance. And rather than letting these feelings derail them, emotionally agile people effectively turn themselves—warts and all—toward their loftiest ambitions.

▪ My interest in emotional agility and this kind of resilience began in apartheid-era South Africa, where I grew up. When I was a child during this violent period of forced segregation, most South Africans had a better chance of being raped than of learning how to read. Government forces removed people from their homes and tortured them; police shot citizens who were simply walking to church. Black and white children were kept separate across all domains of society—schools, restaurants, restrooms, movie theaters.

▪ A friend was gang-raped. My uncle was murdered.

▪ The journaling became a main source of support for me, and I soon recognized that it was helping me to describe, make sense of, and process my experiences. It didn’t make me grieve any less, but it allowed me to move through the trauma. It also showed me the power of facing into, rather than trying to avoid, difficult emotions, and it put me on the career path I have followed ever since.

▪ Just about everyone I know is stressed-out and overloaded with the demands of career, family, health, finances, and a slew of other personal pressures along with large societal forces such as an unsettled economy, rapid cultural change, and a never-ending onslaught of disruptive technologies that distract us at every turn.

▪ One recent study found the effect of multitasking on people’s performance was actually comparable to driving drunk.

▪ My clients tell me all the time that the demands of modern life make them feel caught, hooked, and flipping like fish on a line.

▪ They want to do something bigger with their lives, like explore the world, get married, finish a project, succeed at work, start a business, get healthy, and develop strong relationships with their children and other family members. But their day-to-day actions don’t move them anywhere closer to (and in fact are often completely misaligned with) these desires. Even as they struggle to find and embrace what’s right for themselves, they are trapped not only by their actual circumstances but also by their own self-defeating thoughts and behaviors.

▪ When I was five years old, I decided to run away from home. I was upset with my parents for some reason—I can’t remember why—but I do remember thinking that running away was the only reasonable thing to do.

▪ We lived near a busy road in Johannesburg, and my parents had long drummed into me that I was never, under any circumstances, to cross the street by myself.

▪ When I finally made it home after my oh-so-dramatic breakaway adventure, I had been circling the same block, walking past my own front gate, for hours.

▪ We walk (or run) around the blocks of our lives over and over, obeying rules that are written, implied, or simply imagined, getting hooked by ways of being and doing that don’t serve us.

▪ Even when we acknowledge that we’re hooked and could use some help, the people we turn to—family, friends, kindly bosses, therapists—aren’t always helpful. They have their own issues, limitations, and preoccupations.

▪ In fact, negativity is normal. This is a fundamental fact.

▪ Emotional agility is a process that allows you to be in the moment, changing or maintaining your behaviors to live in ways that align with your intentions and values.

▪ The process of gaining emotional agility unfolds in four essential movements: SHOWING UP

▪ In either case, whether they are accurate reflections of reality or harmful distortions, these thoughts and emotions are a part of who we are, and we can learn to work with them and move on.

▪ STEPPING OUT

▪ The broader view we gain by stepping out means learning to see yourself as the chessboard, filled with possibilities, rather than as any one piece on the board, confined to certain preordained moves.

▪ WALKING YOUR WHY

▪ Recognizing, accepting, and then distancing ourselves from the scary, or painful, or disruptive emotional stuff gives us the ability to engage more of the “take the long view” part of us, which integrates thinking and feeling with long-term values and aspirations, and can help us find new and better ways of getting there.

▪ MOVING ON

▪ THE TINY TWEAKS PRINCIPLE

▪ THE TEETER-TOTTER PRINCIPLE

▪ We, too, need to find the perfect balance between challenge and competence so we’re neither complacent nor overwhelmed but are instead excited, enthusiastic, and invigorated by challenges.

▪ The ultimate goal of emotional agility is to keep a sense of challenge and growth alive and well throughout your life.

◆ CHAPTER 2 | HOOKED

▪ As a psychologist, I find that the books and movies that hook me most are the ones in which the conflict—or at least a big part of it—exists within the hero’s own nature.

▪ The human mind is a meaning-making machine, and a big part of being human involves laboring to make sense of the billions of bits of sensory information bombarding us every day.

▪ The narratives serve a purpose: We tell ourselves these stories to organize our experiences and keep ourselves sane. The trouble is, we all get things wrong.

▪ We then accept these persuasive self-accounts without question, as if they were the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. These are stories that, regardless of their veracity, may have been scribbled on our mental chalkboards in third grade, or even before we could walk or talk. We crawl into these fables and let a sentence or a paragraph, which may have originated thirty or forty years ago and never been objectively tested and verified, represent the totality of our lives.

▪ “My parents got divorced right after I came along, so I’m responsible for my mother’s alcoholism.” “I was the introvert in a family of social butterflies, which is why nobody loves me.”

▪ We create these stories every day on a smaller scale too.

▪ It isn’t just that these dubious, not-always-accurate stories we tell ourselves leave us conflicted or waste our time or result in some chilly days around the house. The bigger issue is the conflict between the world these stories describe and the world we want to live in, the world where we could truly thrive.

▪ During the average day, most of us speak around sixteen thousand words. But our thoughts—our internal voices—produce thousands more. This voice of consciousness is a silent but tireless chatterbox, secretly barraging us with observations, comments, and analyses without pause.

▪ While we often accept the statements bubbling up from within this river of incessant chatter as being factual, most are actually a complex mixture of evaluations and judgments, intensified by our emotions.

▪ Being asked to do something new: “I’m terrified. This is never going to work.”

▪ A social engagement: “I’m going to freeze up and everyone’s going to think I was raised in a cave.”

▪ Meeting up with old friends: “I’m a loser. They’re all living way more exciting lives than I am. And making more money!”

▪ What makes getting hooked almost inevitable is that so many of our responses are just as reflexive.

▪ The hook is usually a situation you encounter in your day-to-day life.

▪ Then there is your autopilot response to that situation.

▪ When you automatically respond in whatever unhelpful way you do, you’re hooked.

▪ Getting yourself hooked begins when you accept thoughts as facts.

▪ All this internal chatter is not only misleading; it’s exhausting. It’s sapping important mental resources you could put to much better use.

▪ Regardless of language, culture, or alphabet, within seconds of being shown the nonsense symbols, the human hearing centers identify the word “kiki” as having a sharp inflection, and the word “bouba” as being softer and more rounded.

▪ This association of a certain shape with a certain sound is thought to take place in part because the angular gyrus, the brain region in which this judgment occurs, sits at the crossroads of our touch, hearing, and vision centers. It engages in sensory blending, integrating sounds, feelings, images, symbols, and gestures, and might even account for our ability to think in metaphors.

▪ Instead, thoughts come fully accessorized with visual images, symbols, idiosyncratic interpretations, judgments, inferences, abstractions, and actions.

▪ the freeze-or-fight-or-flight response

▪ Internal Chatterbox + Technicolor Thought Blending + Emotional Punch = Hooked

▪ The poet John Milton summed it up in the seventeenth century: “The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.”

▪ “If wishes were wings, then pigs would fly.” Meaning that, yes, the mind creates its own universe; but no, we can’t solve our problems through affirmations and positive thinking alone. And the fact is, New Agey solutions that put smiley-face stickers over our problems can make those problems worse.

▪ Who’s in charge—the thinker or the thought?

▪ In 1929, the Belgian painter René Magritte poked the art world in the eye with a canvas called The Treachery of Images. You’ve probably seen it: A tobacco pipe floats above the legend Cici n’est pas une pipe. Translation: “This is not a pipe.”

▪ cautionary tale

▪ Humans love to create mental categories and then fit objects, experiences, and even people into them. If something doesn’t fit in a category, it goes into the category of “things that don’t fit.”

▪ Categories

▪ But when we become too comfortable with—and habituated to—rigid, preexisting categories, we’re using what psychologists term premature cognitive commitment, which is a habitual, inflexible response to ideas, things, and people, even ourselves.

▪ Heuristics

▪ As with the tendency of our thoughts to blend with our emotions, the tendency to fit what we see into boxes for easy sorting—and then to make quick, gut decisions about them—evolved for a reason.

▪ Life is just a hell of a lot easier when you don’t have to analyze every choice (as at those trendy restaurants where the waiter keeps asking you ever more exquisitely detailed questions about your preferences until you want to scream, “Just bring me the damn salad! Dump mayonnaise on it! I don’t care!”). We would all be stuck in paralysis through analysis without our own personal rules of thumb, which allow us to get through the routine stuff without expending a lot of mental energy.

▪ Heuristics kick in the moment we meet someone and immediately begin to determine whether we want to get to know her better or steer clear.

▪ Millennia ago, being able to size up strangers on the spot helped humans form bonds of trust that reached beyond blood relatives.

▪ If human beings lacked the predictive ability of heuristics (“strong handshake, nice smile—seems like a nice guy”) and needed to consciously process every facial expression, conversation, and piece of information anew, we’d have no time for actually living life. Unfortunately, though, our snap impressions can be wrong.

▪ When we make quick judgments, we often overvalue the information that is readily available and undervalue subtleties that might take a while to dig out.

▪ System 1 thoughts are typically fast, automatic, effortless, associative, and implicit, which means they are not available to immediate introspection. They often carry a lot of emotional weight and are ruled by habit and, as a result, are very good at getting us hooked.

▪ System 2 thoughts are slower and more deliberative. They require much more effort and a deeper level of attention. They are also more flexible and amenable to rules that we consciously establish.

▪ It is these System 2 operations that allow us to create the space between stimulus and response that Victor Frankl spoke of, the space that provides for the full expression of our humanity and allows us to thrive.

▪ intuitive thinking

▪ Some intuitive responses arise from practice and skill.

▪ But System 1 gut responses have a dark side. When heuristics begin to dominate the way we process information and behave, we wind up applying our rules of thumb in inappropriate ways, which makes us less able to detect unusual distinctions or new opportunities. We lack agility.

▪ The lesson: Once our minds slip into default mode, it takes a great deal of flexibility to override this state.

▪ Inflated confidence leads old hands to ignore contextual information, and the more familiar an expert is with a particular kind of problem, the more likely he is to pull a prefabricated solution out of his memory bank rather than respond to the specific case at hand.

▪ In general, experts—or people who are highly regarded in any field—are often hooked on their own self-importance.

▪ People who are hooked into a particular way of thinking or behaving are not really paying attention to the world as it is.

▪ People frequently die in fires or crash landings because they try to escape through the same door they used when they entered. In their panic, they rely on an established pattern instead of thinking of another way out. In the same manner, our suffering, our disengagement, our relationship challenges, and our other life difficulties are almost never solved by thinking in the same old, automatic way.

▪ Being emotionally agile involves being sensitive to context and responding to the world as it is right now.

▪ “Who’s in charge—the thinker or the thought?” Are we managing our own lives according to our own values and what is important to us, or are we simply being carried along by the tide?

▪ When we are not in charge of our own lives, when we’re not acting according to our own thoughtful volition and with the full range of options that a perceptive intelligence can conjure, that’s when we get hooked.

▪ THE FOUR MOST COMMON HOOKS HOOK #1: THOUGHT-BLAMING

▪ HOOK #2: MONKEY-MINDEDNESS

▪ HOOK #3: OLD, OUTGROWN IDEAS

▪ HOOK #4: WRONGHEADED RIGHTEOUSNESS

▪ “cutting off your nose to spite your face.”

▪ The freshest and most interesting solutions often come when we embrace “the beginner’s mind,” approaching novel experiences with fresh eyes. This is a cornerstone of emotional agility.

▪ Similarly, some of us tend to pigeonhole ourselves, failing to recognize our own worth as an individual, seeing ourselves narrowly and exclusively as a rich person, or a fat person, or a geek, or a jock.

▪ Things change. We need flexibility to ensure that we can change too.

▪ Emotional agility means being aware and accepting of all your emotions, even learning from the most difficult ones. It also means getting beyond conditioned or preprogrammed cognitive and emotional responses (your hooks) to live in the moment with a clear reading of present circumstances, respond appropriately, and then act in alignment with your deepest values.

◆ CHAPTER 3 | TRYING TO UNHOOK

▪ joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise, contempt, and disgust

▪ Most of us use default behaviors that we hope can deflect or disguise our negative feelings so we won’t have to face them. Others settle deeply into these feelings and struggle to get beyond them. Or we attempt to cope with difficult times and difficult emotions through cynicism, irony, or gallows humor, refusing to admit that anything is worth taking seriously.

▪ When we try to “unhook” simply by killing off our feelings, the real victim is our own well-being.

▪ bottler

▪ Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, written by relationship counselor John Gray, sold ten million copies. Another hugely successful book from that era, You Just Don’t Understand, by linguist Deborah Tannen, explores the different ways men and women use language to communicate, or more precisely, to not communicate.

▪ The problem with bottling is that ignoring troubling emotions doesn’t get at the root of whatever is causing them.

▪ More than once, I’ve met bottlers who find themselves, years later, in the same miserable job, relationship, or circumstance. They’ve been so focused on pushing forward and being a good doobie that they haven’t been in touch with a real emotion in years, which precludes any sort of real change or growth.

▪ Any dieter who has dreamed of chocolate cake and french fries understands the counterproductive nature of “just don’t think about it” and other avoidance strategies.

▪ This is the irony of bottling. It feels like it gives us control, but it actually denies us control. First, it’s your emotions that are calling the shots. Second, the suppressed emotions inevitably surface in unintended ways, a process that psychologists call emotional leakage.

▪ Bottling is usually done with the best intentions, and to the practical person it does feel productive.

▪ It’s no surprise either that bottling can have a negative effect on relationships.

▪ In one study, researchers found that bottling increases other people’s blood pressure, even if those people don’t know that the bottler is bottling.

▪ brooder

▪ When hooked by uncomfortable feelings, brooders stew in their misery, endlessly stirring the pot around, and around, and around.

▪ Brooders can’t let go, and they struggle to compartmentalize as they obsess over a hurt, a perceived failure, a shortcoming, or an anxiety.

▪ Brooding is a cousin of worry.

▪ Brooding also makes you more likely to blame yourself with questions such as “Why do I always react like this?” and “Why can’t I handle this better?”

▪ Brooders are similarly hard to deal with because they tend to dump their real, heavy emotions on others.

▪ Type 1 thoughts are the normal human anxieties that come up as you tackle life’s everyday obstacles: the big project at work, the crazy schedule, last night’s fight, parenting concerns.

▪ Type 1 thoughts are straightforward: “I’m worried about X” or “I’m sad about Y.”

▪ Type 2 thoughts happen when you enter the mental house of mirrors and start to layer in unhelpful thoughts about the thoughts. 

▪ Bottling and brooding are short-term emotional aspirin we reach for with the best of intentions.

▪ In both cases, we lose our ability to be fully engaged with the world around us: to hug our children, to be present with a colleague, to create something new, or to simply enjoy the smell of the newly mowed grass.

▪ We learn these rules from our caregivers and, in turn, we often unintentionally pass them down to our own children.

▪ The genuine smilers had more satisfying marriages, greater feelings of well-being, and were more content. Click.

▪ Given a choice, we’d probably prefer to be slaphappy all the time, and there are advantages to that pleasurable state. More “positive” emotion is linked with a lower risk of various psychological illnesses, including depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder.

▪ Positive emotions also drive us to success, help us make better decisions, reduce the risk of disease, and allow us to live longer.

▪ With all this, you might presume happiness ranks right up there with food and sunshine in its contribution to human well-being. But as our increasingly obese, melanoma-afflicted society has come to understand, it is possible to have too much of a good thing.

▪ I hope to get you to keep the pursuit of happiness in perspective and to see your “negative” emotions in a new and more accepting light.

▪ When we’re overly cheerful, we tend to neglect important threats and dangers.

▪ It’s not too big a stretch to suggest that being excessively happy could kill you. You might engage in riskier behaviors like drinking too much (“A fifth round on me!”), binge eating (“Mmm, more cake!”), skipping birth control (“What could possibly go wrong?”), and using drugs (“Let’s party!”). An excess of freewheeling giddiness and a relative absence of more sober emotions can even be a marker for mania, a dangerous symptom of psychological illness.

▪ People with high happiness levels sometimes exhibit behavior that is actually more rigid. That’s because mood affects the way our brains process information.

▪ When life is good, and we feel great, and when the environment is safe and familiar, we tend not to think long and hard about anything too challenging—which helps explain why highly positive people can be less creative than those with a more moderate level of positive emotion.

▪ Not to stereotype the happy among us, but when we’re in an “everything is awesome!” mood, we’re far more likely to jump to conclusions and resort to stereotypes.

▪ The happy more often place disproportionate emphasis on early information and disregard or minimize later details.

▪ Our so-called negative emotions encourage slower, more systematic cognitive processing. We rely less on quick conclusions and pay more attention to subtle details that matter.

▪ Isn’t it interesting that the most famous fictional detectives are notably grumpy? And that the most carefree kid in high school is rarely valedictorian?

▪ “Negative” moods summon a more attentive, accommodating thinking style that leads you to really examine facts in a fresh and creative way.

▪ It’s when we’re in a bit of a funk that we focus and dig down. People in negative moods tend to be less gullible and more skeptical, while happy folks may accept easy answers and trust false smiles.

▪ The paradox of happiness is that deliberately striving for it is fundamentally incompatible with the nature of happiness itself.

▪ Striving for happiness establishes an expectation, which confirms the saying that expectations are resentments waiting to happen.

▪ That’s why holidays and family events are often disappointing, if not downright depressing. Our expectations are so high that it’s almost inevitable we’ll be let down.

▪ The aggressive pursuit of happiness is also isolating.

▪ Happiness also comes in a variety of cultural variations that open up the possibility of being happy in the wrong way.

▪ In North America, happiness tends to be defined in terms of personal accomplishment (including pleasure); whereas in East Asia, happiness is associated with social harmony.

▪ To be happy within a given culture depends more than a little on how in sync your feelings are with that culture’s definition of happiness.

▪ In short, chasing after happiness can be just as self-defeating as the bottling and brooding we talked about earlier.

▪ GOOD NEWS ABOUT BAD MOODS

▪ While it’s rarely fun to be in a bad mood, and it’s certainly not healthy to constantly stew in negative emotions, here’s what experiences of sadness, anger, guilt, or fear can do:

▪ Help us form arguments

▪ Improve memory

▪ Encourage perseverance.

▪ Make us more polite and attentive

▪ Encourage generosity

▪ Make us less prone to confirmation bias

▪ Not surprisingly, great writers from the Greek tragedians to the romantic poets to the authors of those huge nineteenth-century Russian novels have found much that was instructive and valuable on the dark side of the human emotional scale.

▪ Our raw feelings can be the messengers we need to teach us things about ourselves and can prompt insights into important life directions.

▪ In addition to anger (a.k.a. wrath), envy is one of the other “seven deadly sins.”

▪ In truth, envy can be a strong motivator—even stronger than admiration—in driving us toward self-improvement. One study showed that students who expressed benign envy toward a more successful student showed greater motivation than those who expressed admiration. The envious participants ramped up their schoolwork and performed better on various verbal tasks.

▪ Embarrassment and guilt can serve important social functions in fostering appeasement and furthering cooperation. Sadness is a signal to ourselves that something is wrong—often that we are looking for a better way to be here and participate.

◆ CHAPTER 4 | SHOWING UP

▪ Joseph Campbell’s The Hero with a Thousand Faces. In that 1949 classic, Campbell explored the idea, first developed by the psychologist Carl Jung, that all humans share certain universal but unconscious mental models for relationships and important life experiences.

▪ archetypes

▪ These archetypes show up in everything from the King Arthur legends to Harry Potter to online role-playing games. The existence of universal archetypes might explain why people all over the world fall in love with the same kinds of stories, and why you can find similar myths in very different cultures.

▪ The struggling filmmaker used the archetypes and rewrote his script to be more of a mythic hero’s quest. That filmmaker was George Lucas, and his movie, Star Wars, went on to become one of the most popular films ever made.

▪ In modern life, we often find ourselves at the edges of our own dark places—all the more terrifying for being inside us.

▪ Our hidden demons are simply the residue of perfectly ordinary and almost universal insecurity, self-doubt, and fear of failure.

▪ As with every hero’s journey, our movement toward a better life begins with showing up.

▪ It does mean we must face up to, make peace with, and find an honest and open way to live with them. When we show up fully, with awareness and acceptance, even the worst demons usually back down. Simply by facing up to the scary things and giving them a name, we often strip them of their power.

▪ We end the tug-of-war by dropping the rope.

▪ Decades of psychological research shows that our life satisfaction in the face of inevitable worries, regrets, and sad experiences depends not so much on how many of these things we experience, or even their intensity, but on the way we deal with them.

▪ Showing up is not a heroic exercise of will but simply looking our personal tormentors in the eye and saying, “Okay. You’re here, and I’m here. Let’s talk. Because I am big enough to contain all my feelings and past experiences, I can accept all these parts of my existence without being crushed or terrified.”

▪ Primo Levi

▪ If This Is a Man

▪ Levi had discovered the vital importance of having your feelings and experiences acknowledged, not just by other people but also by oneself.

▪ Perfection is one-dimensional, unrealistic, boring.

▪ A satisfying movie is one in which the complex positives and negatives of hero and villain get resolved.

▪ In real life, our successes come from how well we’re able to live with and learn from our own flaws or dark side. And the path to that resolution, and that learning, begins with showing up.

▪ self-acceptance

▪ SELF-COMPASSION

▪ Imagine if we each treated ourselves with that same kind of compassion and support rather than the self-recrimination we so often fall into instead?

▪ That doesn’t mean soft-pedaling the negatives, or twisting ourselves into knots trying to work around them, or denying that they exist. Rather, it means forgiving ourselves for our mistakes or imperfections so we can move on to better, more productive things.

▪ Showing up takes guts. It’s scary to consider what we might learn about ourselves when we look inward.

▪ It means bringing history and context into the equation to find the full significance of what’s there, and then putting that understanding to work to make things better.

▪ Showing up involves acknowledging our thoughts without ever having to believe they are literally true.

▪ Part of Mandela’s genius was that as he worked to undo the damage done by institutionalized hatred, he led his country beyond the blood lust and score settling that has kept hostility alive for centuries in other parts of the world. When it came to facing up to South Africa’s deeply painful past, Mandela’s government established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, whereby people would show up, own up to what they had done or what had been done to them, and then move on. It was not about an eye for an eye or punishment or recrimination, but about healing and moving on with building a new, just and democratic society.

▪ In fact, one of the great paradoxes of human experience is that we can’t change ourselves or our circumstances until we accept what exists right now.

▪ Acceptance is a prerequisite for change.

▪ We still don’t like the things we don’t like; we just cease to be at war with them. And once the war is over, change can begin.

▪ I often advise my clients that a good way to become more accepting and compassionate toward yourself is to look back at the child you once were.

▪ After all, you didn’t get to choose your parents, your economic circumstances, your personality, or your body type. Recognizing you had to play the hand you were dealt is often the first step toward showing yourself more warmth, kindness, and forgiveness. You did the best you could under the circumstances. And you survived.

▪ The next step is to think of yourself as the hurt child you once were, running up to you, the adult you are now.

▪ Showing yourself kindness gets even more important during life’s rough patches.

▪ Guilt is the feeling of burden and regret that comes from knowing you’ve failed or done wrong. It’s no fun, but like all our emotions, it has its purpose. In fact, society depends on guilty feelings to keep us from repeating our errors and misdeeds.

▪ A lack of guilt is actually one of the defining features of a sociopath.

▪ Shame casts one not as a human being who did a bad thing, but as a human being who is bad.

▪ Maybe you even did something really wrong. Even so, this transgression does not make you an irredeemably awful human being. You can make amends, apologize, and get to work paying your debt to society, whether that means sending flowers or serving time. You can strive to learn from your mistakes and do better in the future.

▪ Self-compassion is the antidote to shame.

▪ SELF-COMPASSION IS NOT ABOUT LYING TO YOURSELF

▪ It means looking at yourself from an outside perspective: a broad and inclusive view that doesn’t deny reality but instead recognizes your challenges and failures as part of being human.

▪ You can’t have real self-compassion without first facing the truth about who you are and what you feel. It’s when we lack compassion that we’re more likely to develop false bravado and grandiose overconfidence in an effort to deny the possibility of failure. When we lack compassion, we see the world as just as unforgiving as we are, so the very idea of failure is crippling.

▪ Compassion gives us the freedom to redefine ourselves as well as the all-important freedom to fail, which contains within it the freedom to take the risks that allow us to be truly creative.

▪ SELF-COMPASSION DOES NOT MAKE YOU WEAK OR LAZY

▪ We all now run faster, work harder, stay up later, and multitask more aggressively just to keep up. In this environment, in which we’re expected to approach life like an endless Ironman competition, showing yourself compassion can be seen as a sign that you lack ambition or don’t care about success as much as the person next to you does.

▪ Self-compassionate people aim just as high as self-critical people do. The difference is that self-compassionate people don’t fall apart when, as sometimes happens, they don’t meet their goals.

▪ After all, it’s associated with health behaviors such as eating right, exercising, sleeping well, and managing stress during tough times, which is when you need to care for yourself the most. It even strengthens your immune system, helping to ward off illness, while encouraging social connection and positive emotion. All of this helps you to keep on truckin’ and be your best self.

▪ Self-acceptance and self-compassion do not move the merchandise. So what we’re confronted with instead are relentless invitations to compare ourselves with others—and, inevitably, to come out lacking.

▪ We citizens of the industrialized world, however, often live hundreds or thousands of miles away from our nearest relative, in anonymous and isolating cities, where we’re bombarded by images not just of all the cool gadgets and other gleaming goodies we do not possess, but also of gorgeous men and women who set a standard of photoshopped perfection that is impossible to meet.

▪ It will come as no surprise to anyone that, according to the research, being exposed to people who are hotter, richer, or more powerful than we are can send our own self-image into the toilet. It’s called the contrast effect

▪ You might be content living in your tract house and proud of your husband who teaches special-needs children, but you might be less so after running into your old boyfriend who’s now a thoracic surgeon who volunteers for Doctors Without Borders and just published his first novel.

▪ Self-acceptance usually takes a big hit anytime we start making comparisons.

▪ And social comparison doesn’t just bring us down when we come out on the short end.

▪ So, in the interest of your emotional agility, here’s my advice: Keep your eyes on your own work.

▪ Teachers used it as a warning to students not to cheat during a test. But it had a second purpose too: to stop you from second-guessing yourself.

▪ Keeping your eyes on your own work is even more important when you’re tempted to compare yourself with a person completely out of your league.

▪ Comparing yourself with the Joshua Bells or Mark Zuckerbergs or Michael Jordans or Meryl Streeps of this world is like learning to swim and comparing yourself with a dolphin. What’s the point? You have to be you, as you are, rather than a desperately striving, lesser version of somebody else.

▪ YOUR INNER CRITIC

▪ And why do we take someone else’s occasional bad review of our behavior or performance more to heart than we take our friends’ much more frequent compliments?

▪ People can be harsh, biased, unkind, narcissistic, self-serving, and just plain mean, which is why it’s vitally important to remember that someone else’s negative evaluation of you is rarely objective, and that there is absolutely no reason to interpret that bad review as the truth, much less to incorporate it into your own self-evaluation.

▪ Stories that do carry some element of truth can actually be the most troublesome, because we put a lot of stock in “truth,” no matter how selective and partial it may be.

▪ Your story is your story. You need to own it, rather than it owning you, and to honor it with compassion.

▪ The point is, the person who has the final say over what’s of value in your life should be you.

▪ Developing meaningful compassion for yourself does not mean deluding yourself. You need to be deeply aware of who you are, for better and for worse, and fully attuned to the world around you. But even when we’re dealing with the real world as it really is, you have enormous leeway in how you respond to it.

▪ CHOOSING WILLINGNESS

▪ Life, on the other hand, has a way of humbling us, and heartbreak is built into its agreement with the world. We’re young, until we’re not. We’re healthy, until we’re not. We’re with those we love, until we’re not. Life’s beauty is inseparable from its fragility.

▪ One of the greatest human triumphs is to choose to make room in our hearts for both the joy and the pain, and to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. This means seeing feelings not as being “good” or “bad” but as just “being.”

▪ What we really need to do, though, is also what is most simple and obvious: nothing. That is, to just welcome these inner experiences, breathe into them, and learn their contours without racing for the exits.

▪ If you were trying desperately to quit an addiction to smoking, you’d expect to crave cigarettes for a while. The craving would be normal and physiologically based—so why would you be judgmental about it? In fact, it’s feeling the need to control a craving that can turn the craving into an irresistible compulsion. Which is why an open acceptance—ending the tug-of-war by dropping the rope—is the way to go.

▪ Sometimes, in our struggle with difficult circumstances, we make things much worse for ourselves. We take raw pain and convert it into real suffering.

▪ What Theresa needed to do was to show up: show up to her sadness and disappointment and be fully present with it. This meant acknowledging the true extent of her grief, saying goodbye to the child she’d lost, honoring the memory of that life that would never be, and then allowing herself to fully experience whatever she was feeling. This would not necessarily mean she’d get over her loss or be happy about the fact that she’d never give birth to a child of her own. But by confronting her pain and acknowledging it, and then by embracing every stage of her sorrow, she would be able to move through the experience, learn from it, and come out the other side, rather than being stuck, paralyzed by sadness.

▪ Unfortunately, many adults still don’t use their words to define and understand their experiences and the emotions surrounding them.

▪ alexithymia, which literally means “no words for mood.”

▪ Words have enormous power.

▪ The wrong word has led to wars, not to mention the end of countless marriages. There’s a world of difference between stress and anger, or stress and disappointment, or stress and anxiety. If we can’t accurately label what we’re feeling, it becomes difficult to communicate well enough to get the support we need.

▪ Alexithymia isn’t a clinical diagnosis, but it’s a difficulty that millions of people struggle with every day.

▪ Trouble labeling emotions is associated with poor mental health, dissatisfaction in jobs and relationships, and plenty of other ills. People with this condition are also more likely to report physical symptoms like headaches and backaches. It’s as if their feelings are being expressed physically rather than verbally. It’s also true that sometimes, when people can’t clearly express their feelings in words, the only emotion that comes through loud and clear is anger, and the unfortunate way they express it is by putting a fist through the wall—or worse.

▪ Learning to label emotions with a more nuanced vocabulary can be absolutely transformative.

▪ WHAT THE FUNC?

▪ Along with the importance of precisely labeling our emotions comes the promise that once we do give them a name, our feelings can provide useful information.

▪ They signal rewards and dangers. They point us in the direction of our hurt. They can also tell us which situations to engage with and which to avoid. They can be beacons, not barriers, helping us identify what we most care about and motivating us to make positive changes.

▪ I have realized that my guilt can help me set my priorities and sometimes realign my actions. After all, we don’t feel guilty about the things we don’t care about.

▪ My on-the-road guilt signals to me that I miss my children and value my family. It reminds me that my life is heading in the right direction when I’m spending more time with them. My guilt is a flashing arrow pointing toward the people I love and the life I want to lead.

▪ On the face of it, that anger could seem like, well, just anger. But deeper down, it also could be a signal that teamwork is a value you hold dear, or that you feel less secure in your job than you’d realized. Anger is no fun to experience, but the awareness it provides can be channeled into active steps. It can be a flashing arrow pointing you toward positive changes like finding a new job or scheduling time for a performance review with your boss.

▪ Once we stop struggling to eliminate distressing feelings or to smother them with positive affirmations or rationalizations, they can teach us valuable lessons. Self-doubt and self-criticism, even anger and regret, shine light into those dark, murky, sometimes demon-haunted places that you most want to ignore, which are places of vulnerability or weakness.

▪ Showing up to these feelings can help you anticipate the pitfalls and prepare more effective ways of coping during critical moments.

▪ If you can confront both your internal feelings and your external options—while maintaining the distinction between the two—you’ll have a much better chance at having a good day, not to mention a meaningful life.

◆ CHAPTER 5 | STEPPING OUT

▪ Pennebaker

▪ His depression lifted and he felt liberated. He began to reconnect with his deep love for his wife. But the writing had an even further-reaching impact. For the first time, he started to see the purpose and possibilities in his life.

▪ Just months after the emotionally charged writing sessions, the men who had delved into how they truly felt were three times more likely to have been reemployed than those in the control groups. The writing not only helped the men process their experiences; it helped them step out from their despondent inertia and into meaningful action.

▪ In the process of writing, they were able to create the distance between the thinker and the thought, the feeler and the feeling, that allowed them to gain a new perspective, unhook, and move forward.

▪ More often than you might expect, they found ways of turning these obstacles into opportunities to connect more directly with their deepest values.

▪ Don’t worry about punctuation, sloppiness, or coherence. Simply go wherever your mind takes you, curiously and without judgment. Write just for yourself and not for some eventual reader. Do this for a few days.

▪ hilarious rampage

▪ We’ve all experienced this ability to separate ourselves from our experience and see it from a different perspective.

▪ It was almost like one of those out-of-body experiences in which the soul is said to rise up to the ceiling and look back down at the scene from above. With this new perspective, I was able to notice my anger for what it was: blind rage, directed at the wrong person.

▪ I switched gears, apologized, and then from a perspective that included another’s point of view, we moved on to a space of constructive and collaborative problem solving.

▪ This is the place from which you can choose behaviors based on your values rather than indulging in what your thoughts, emotions, and stories are insisting that you do. This newly created space allows you to be sensitive to the context, to shift your actions to what will work in the here and now, rather than being driven by mindless impulses—like Justice! Revenge! You can’t treat me like this!

▪ In fact, to live an intentional, meaningful life and to really thrive, one of the most critical skills to develop is this ability to take a meta-view, the view from above that broadens your perspective and makes you sensitive to context. This skill helps you gain new perspective on your own emotions and on how others might be feeling, and is a key factor in our ability to self-reflect.

▪ We can torture ourselves over the simplest screwups, alternately brooding and bottling, waking up in the middle of the night ten or twenty or forty years later to relive some stupid thing we did in junior high.

▪ No matter how certain we are about the best course of action, the world is constantly changing, and circumstances are unpredictable. And since no one knows for certain what will happen, in battle or otherwise, everybody is bound to make a few decisions that turn out to be not so effective.

▪ For ages, monks and mystics have used practices such as meditation to dissolve the fusion between thought and thinker, impulse and action, freeing the mind from some of its tighter constraints and distorted interpretations.

▪ When these sorts of practices first became popular with Westerners in the late sixties, the operative phrase was “Be here now.”

▪ mindfulness

▪ The results showed changes in the brain regions associated not just with stress but also with memory, sense of self, and empathy.

▪ By helping us focus, mindfulness also increases competence. It improves memory, creativity, and our moods, as well as relationships, health, and longevity in general. By paying attention to what’s going on around us, rather than ignoring it or just going along with the program, we can become more flexible and insightful.

▪ Ellen Langer

▪ Meanwhile, when we’re in the audience, attending mindfully helps us break through our own distractions or premature judgments and see what others have to offer.

▪ Unfortunately, the term has become such a buzzword, especially in business circles, that there’s now a bit of a backlash.

▪ You really don’t need to take out the recycling mindfully, or comb your hair mindfully—that is, unless you find it rewarding.

▪ Mindlessness so easily leads us down the path of getting hooked. It’s the state of unawareness and autopilot. You’re not really present. Instead you’re relying too heavily on rigid rules or shopworn distinctions that haven’t been thought through.

▪ When you’re mindful of your anger, you can observe it with greater sensitivity, focus, and emotional clarity, perhaps discovering where the anger is actually coming from. You might even discover that your “anger” is really sadness or fear. But the calm awareness—the just being—that’s associated with hard-core mindfulness does not come easily to everyone.

▪ Blaise Pascal, the seventeenth-century mathematician and philosopher, famously wrote, “All men’s miseries derive from not being able to sit in a quiet room alone.”

▪ Timothy Wilson

▪ It could be they’re unaware that we all have a “self,” an entity that exists apart from our appetites and attitudes, something more than our social-media presence, our résumé, or our status; more than what we own, what we know, whom we love, or what we do.

▪ Mindfulness can help us get more comfortable with this inner essence and help us follow the original commandment of self-improvement, straight from the Oracle of Delphi in ancient Greece: Know thyself.

▪ We can’t read the instructions when we’re stuck inside the jar.

▪ Mindfulness guides us to become more emotionally agile by allowing us to observe the thinker having the thoughts. Simply paying attention brings the self out of the shadows. It creates the space between thought and action that we need to ensure we’re acting with volition, rather than simply out of habit.

▪ As a result, the mental state of mindfulness lets us see the world through multiple perspectives and go forward with higher levels of self-acceptance, tolerance, and self-kindness.

▪ When we decide to curiously explore the world inside us and outside, we can make other decisions more flexibly. We can intentionally breathe space into our reactions and make choices based on what matters to us and what we hope to be.

▪ CREATING THE SPACE IN BETWEEN

▪ imposter syndrome

▪ When she learned to bring a mindful curiosity to her experiences, she was able to step out, to turn the telescope around to take in a wider perspective.

▪ They’ve given their fear a name, and then are able to have had some fun at its expense. By doing so, they create more space to be themselves. They’ve stepped out.

▪ You can accept your craving for crème caramel, notice your “I want that!” thoughts, and then choose not to reach out your hand. This is not bottling, because you are not ignoring or denying or trying to suppress the thought, emotion, or desire. Rather, you are curiously noticing it and the information it brings but not letting it call the shots.

▪ Thoughts and emotions contain information, not directions.

▪ Emotional agility means having any number of troubling thoughts or emotions and still managing to act in a way that serves how you most want to live. That’s what it means to step out and off the hook.

▪ Research shows that using the third person this way is an effective technique for distancing yourself from stress (or anxiety or frustration or sadness) that can help you regulate your reactions. It also leads people to view future stressful situations more as challenges and less as threats.

▪ TECHNIQUES FOR STEPPING OUT

▪ 1. Think process

▪ 2. Get contradictory

▪ You can feel that you’re both the victim and the person responsible for a relationship breakdown. Embracing and accepting these seeming contradictions improves your tolerance for uncertainty.

▪ 3. Have a laugh

▪ 4. Change your point of view

▪ 5. Call it out

▪ Anytime you get hooked, identify that thought for what it is (a thought) and that emotion for what it is (an emotion).

▪ Remember you have no obligation to accept your thoughts’ or emotions’ opinions, much less act on their advice.

▪ 6. Talk to yourself in the third person

▪ With a receptive, open, broader view, we can hold our thoughts and emotions lightly, not be hooked on old stories, and not prejudge new experiences as they come along.

▪ Monica is married to a guy named David. They love each other deeply, but Monica has one gripe: Every day, her husband comes home from work and drops his coat on the floor.

▪ Trouble is, when we’re hooked, that one dimension takes over. We stop seeing the people involved in our hooks as fully rounded human beings who exist outside our perception of them, or beyond what we need from them.

▪ was acutely aware of 

▪ She made a conscious decision, going forward, to let go of the subjective threads she’d woven into that coat and to assume only the most generous intentions on David’s part.

▪ A friend, Richard, told me about a fifteen-year exercise in frustration with his wife, Gail.

▪ He also knew that she did not enjoy cooking, but that she did enjoy pulling out the nice china and setting the table and arranging flowers, activities that also contributed to their dinner parties. Any other interpretation he might apply toward her resistance to helping in the kitchen was a choice on his part, and not one that helped his relationship with his wife.

▪ What you let go of will be different from what another person chooses to let go of. Sometimes it is letting go of a past experience. Sometimes it means releasing an expectation or a relationship. Sometimes letting go means forgiving others. Sometimes it means forgiving yourself.

▪ Just saying the words “let go” is enough to bring a sense of hope and relief.

▪ In truth, though, when we let go of that one thing, we are left with everything else. Clinging to that one small piece of emotional driftwood prevents us from feeling part of the dynamic system that is the universe itself.

▪ This does not mean a passive resignation to fate, but rather a vital engagement with the way things actually are, unfiltered and undistorted by rigid mental lenses.

◆ CHAPTER 6 | WALKING YOUR WHY

▪ No one runs up to you and hands you all of that money. You have to ask for it. And by asking for it, what’s implied underneath is that I am more valuable than others; more valuable than the cook, the maintenance man, the janitor.

▪ Shadyac didn’t renounce his material possessions altogether; he just winnowed them down until they had an appropriate place in his life, so he had more time and energy to devote to his true priorities.

▪ “[We have] a very extrinsic model of success,” he explained. “You have to have a certain job status, a certain amount of wealth. I think true success is intrinsic . . . It’s love. It’s kindness. It’s community.”

▪ “Walking your why” is the art of living by your own personal set of values—the beliefs and behaviors that you hold dear and that give you meaning and satisfaction.

▪ WE MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE NOT OUR OWN

▪ We’re constantly bombarded with messages—from culture, advertisers, our upbringing, our religious training, and our families, friends, and peers—about what is important and what makes us worthy.

▪ we all have a tendency to simply plow ahead with blinders on, just getting through the day

▪ If we need guidance, we look around to check out what other people are doing, mindlessly choosing all sorts of things that we’ve been told are universal keys to satisfaction, such as a college education, home ownership, or having children. In fact, these are not for everyone. It’s just a lot faster and easier to follow what we see than to work it out for ourselves.

▪ Other people’s actions and choices affect us more than we realize, on every level, through a fascinating phenomenon called social contagion.

▪ Studies show that certain behaviors really are like colds and flus—you can catch them from other people. Your risk of becoming obese increases with each obese person you come into contact with. Your chances of getting divorced, a decision you’d think would be deeply personal and individual, are higher if other couples in your peer group are also splitting up.

▪ Your personal life can be affected by people you don’t even know.

▪ Sometimes, this behavior is okay (one more airplane movie isn’t going to kill you); sometimes it’s even beneficial:

▪ If all your friends exercise regularly, you might be more likely to get off the couch.

▪ But make too many mindless, autopilot decisions over the long haul, and eventually you’ll find yourself living what feels like somebody else’s life—a life aligned with values you don’t necessarily ascribe to.

▪ To make decisions that match up with the way you hope to live going forward, you have to be in touch with the things that matter to you so you can use them as signposts.

▪ Making choices and negotiating relationships without a clear set of governing values at the front of your mind is taxing labor.

▪ WHAT DO I WANT MY LIFE TO LOOK LIKE?

▪ By connecting with their distant selves and with their values, they were able to understand themselves as people with core beliefs and a moral keel that would remain stable, even as other elements and situations in their lives changed.

▪ Creating continuity of self can both help to prevent bad choices and encourage good ones.

▪ As you might expect, the group who saw older avatars allocated more than twice as much of their theoretical windfall to their imaginary retirement funds. Taking time for the long view leads to actions that benefit the long term.

▪ Jeff Kinney

▪ For him, it’s about giving something back to the world that has given him so much, and it feels right. “If one kid’s life is changed because of this bookstore,” he said, “then the whole thing was worth it.”

▪ If you know your own personal values and generally live by them, you are also likely to be comfortable with who you are. You don’t need to compare yourself with other people because you’re a success—by your own definition.

▪ Instead, I see values not as rules that are supposed to govern us, but as qualities of purposeful action that we can bring to many aspects of life.

▪ Values aren’t universal; what’s “right” for one person may well not be for someone else. But identifying what matters to you, whether that’s career success, creativity, close relationships, honesty, altruism—there is an almost infinite list to choose from—gives you a priceless source of continuity.

▪ Values serve as a kind of psychological keel to keep you steady.

▪ A colleague of mine describes values as “facets on a diamond.” Sometimes, he says, “when you turn one to face you squarely, another may have to move away—but it is still there, part of the whole, and visible through the prism.”

▪ Here are some other characteristics of values: They are freely chosen and have not been imposed on you. They are not goals; that is, they are ongoing rather than fixed. They guide you rather than constrain you. They are active, not static. They allow you to get closer to the way you want to live your life. They bring you freedom from social comparisons. They foster self-acceptance, which is crucial to mental health.

▪ Above all, a value is something you can use. It helps you place your feet in the right direction as you journey through life, no matter where life leads you.

▪ Elizabeth Gilbert

▪ I never promised the universe that I would write brilliantly; I only promised the universe that I would write. So I put my head down and sweated through it, as per my vows.

▪ Here are a few questions to ask yourself in order to start identifying your values: Deep down, what matters to me? What relationships do I want to build? What do I want my life to be about? How do I feel most of the time? What kinds of situations make me feel most vital? If a miracle occurred and all the anxiety and stress in my life were suddenly gone, what would my life look like, and what new things would I pursue?

▪ Are there particular areas in which people consistently seek your advice and expertise? Are you most alive doing certain activities and work projects? Is there a time when you feel most yourself?

▪ When you know what you do care about, you can be free from the things you don’t care about.

▪ There are all kinds of parents in the world, and there is no single right way to be one, even within your city or neighborhood or group of friends.

▪ Some potential questions to ask yourself about parenting: “What do I want people to observe when they see me with my child? What would I observe if I watched myself? Is my behavior reasonably consistent from one setting to the next? Does my behavior align with my core beliefs about what a good parent is?”

▪ Parenting

▪ If you discover after a few weeks that you have very little to write down in answer to this question, press the issue another way by asking yourself when you wake up each morning, “If this were my last day on earth, how would I act to make it a great final day?”

▪ Once you’ve done something new, you can decide whether it was worth your time, and before long you’ll have a list of actions and experiences that align with what you believe to be important.

▪ Joseph Darby

▪ Conformity and loyalty are key concepts in military culture. And under stressful conditions, members of tightly knit military units can fall prey to dangerous groupthink, exhibiting violent and dehumanizing behavior that in other contexts they would condemn as wrong.

▪ Resisting the pull of group behavior takes a great deal of strength, and Darby was able to make the dramatic switch by acting from a place of truth within himself. By staying aligned with his values, he was able not only to break free from the group’s behavior but also to muster the courage to make the abuse public, even though he was so afraid he’d be found out as the whistle-blower that at one point he slept with a gun under his pillow.

▪ When you connect with your real self, and what you believe to be important, the gulf between how you feel and how you behave closes up. You begin to live your life without as many regrets, and without as much second-guessing.

▪ credit-default swaps

▪ As Aristotle told his Greek friends long before they joined the European Union, “You are what you habitually do.”

▪ It’s not just that values are nice things to have. Rather, research shows that values actually help us access greater levels of willpower and grit and safeguard us from negative social contagion. They also protect us against subconscious stereotypes and beliefs that limit us without our even knowing they’re there—and yet can have a real, negative impact on our ability to face challenges.

▪ One important study found that just identifying their personal values helped protect a group of minority students from absorbing the dangerous cultural message that they couldn’t perform as well academically as their more privileged peers.

▪ When we make choices based on what we know to be true for ourselves, rather than being led by others telling us what is right or wrong, important or cool, we have the power to face almost any circumstance in a constructive way. Rather than being caught up in pretending or social comparison, we can stride forward with confidence.

▪ Once you’ve identified your values, you then have to take them out for a spin. This requires a certain amount of courage, but you can’t aim to be fearless. Instead, you should aim to walk directly into your fears, with your values as your guide, toward what matters to you.

▪ Courage is not an absence of fear; courage is fear walking.

▪ It was terrifying, but she never wavered, not even when the Gestapo arrested her and sentenced her to death. She later described a sense of relief at the news; at last she would be free from the fear that had come with the brave path she had chosen.

▪ without action, a value is just an aspiration, rather than the way we really are.

▪ Whether your values-based actions are a matter of life and death, as Sendler’s were, or of the blessedly mundane “should I go to sleep on time or indulge in another hour of Netflix?” variety, you will eventually arrive at what I call a choice point, a metaphorical fork in the road where you are presented with just that, a choice.

▪ The more you choose moves that are toward your values, the more vital, effective, and meaningful your life is likely to become.

▪ Unfortunately, when we’re hooked by difficult thoughts, feelings, and situations, we often start making moves away from our values.

▪ If you value relationships and hope to get married, you can put that value in motion by Internet dating, taking a cooking or rock-climbing class, or joining a book club where you might meet someone who shares your interests. Insisting that you’re too shy or nervous to take such actions is allowing yourself to make a move away and is directly opposite from what you say you value.

▪ intellectual commitment

▪ GOAL CONFLICTS

▪ The key is to think about these choices not as better or worse but as equal and different. Then it’s up to you to find the reason for making the choice, not because one thing is better than the other, but simply because a decision has to be made.

▪ One of the biggest issues many people face on this front is creating a work-life balance. For many of us—myself included—there’s a constant tug between working and spending time with our kids and partners.

▪ Since values relate to quality—rather than quantity—of action, the amount of time you spend enacting your values doesn’t necessarily reflect how much they matter to you, or limit the degree of engagement you bring to the precious moments you have with your loved ones or to the limited time you have at work.

▪ social snacking

▪ We all spend time in different value domains depending on our circumstances, and being in one doesn’t mean you value the others any less.

▪ If you can willingly accept the pain associated with giving up the road not taken, you can embrace the decision you did make and move forward with clarity.

▪ Values, in fact, are not limiting or restrictive. Instead, they give us latitude we might not otherwise allow ourselves by providing a continuous web of support. Knowing our values also makes us flexible and open to new experiences. We can use our values to make more deliberate, satisfying “toward moves” and fewer reflexive, unproductive “away moves.”

▪ We all face dilemmas, no matter how solid our beliefs and regardless of our specific decisions.

▪ illustrious career

▪ Even if your choice turns out to be wrong, you can at least take comfort in knowing you made the decision for the right reasons. You can show up to yourself with courage, curiosity, and self-compassion.

▪ amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS

▪ By knowing who you are and what you stand for, you come to life’s choices with the most powerful tool of all: your full self.

▪ Dance if you can.

◆ CHAPTER 7 | MOVING ON

▪ The tiny behaviors feed back on themselves and compound with time, as every interaction builds on the previous interaction, no matter how seemingly trivial. Each person’s moments of pettiness and anger, or generosity and lovingness, create a feedback loop that makes the overall relationship either more toxic or happier going forward.

▪ In the early fifties, a singer named Kitty Kallen had a huge hit with a torch song called “Little Things Mean a Lot.” And she was right.

▪ Tweaking the little things can have a powerful impact when doing so allows us to align our behavior more closely with what really matters to us.

▪ Nature favors evolution, not revolution.

▪ The most effective way to transform your life, therefore, is not by quitting your job and moving to an ashram, but, to paraphrase Teddy Roosevelt, by doing what you can, with what you have, where you are.

▪ When our approach to problems is too grand (“I need a new career!”), we invite frustration. But when we aim for tiny tweaks (“I’m going to have one discussion a week with someone outside my field.”), the cost of failure is pretty small. When we know we have little to lose, our stress levels drop, and our confidence increases.

▪ In looking for the right places to make these tiny changes, there are three broad areas of opportunity. You can tweak your beliefs—or what psychologists call your mindset; you can tweak your motivations; and you can tweak your habits.

▪ A NEW OUTLOOK: TWEAKING OUR MINDSETS

▪ The tiny tweak in mindset had made a huge difference.

▪ Mindset

▪ People with a fixed mindset follow an “entity” theory of self and believe important qualities such as intelligence and personality are fixed traits that cannot be changed. People with a growth mindset believe that these basic qualities are “malleable” and can be improved through learning and effort.

▪ After all, those who are open to change and believe they can do better—and that their efforts matter—have a sense of agency over their performance and rise to the challenge. So setbacks or failures don’t keep them down, and they persevere, even when they’re frustrated.

▪ The parent who praises a child’s accomplishment by saying, “You studied hard!” promotes a growth mindset. The parent who says, “Look at your A, son! You’re a genius!” promotes a fixed mindset.

▪ If a child comes to believe that success depends on innate intelligence, and that intelligence is a fixed commodity, then he’s more likely to think there’s nothing he can do when the going inevitably gets tougher and he finds himself struggling in Spanish or pre-calculus.

▪ Dweck, however, notes that it is important not to confuse having a growth mindset with simply working harder. If a child spends hours and hours studying, but her grades stay the same or her understanding of the subject doesn’t improve, it’s time to consider other strategies.

▪ Nor should parents stop at simply praising a child’s effort. If your daughter fails her history test, “Good try!” might make her feel better but won’t help her improve. Though, Dweck says, “Let’s talk about what you tried, and what you can try next” just might.

▪ Change is often seen as a onetime event that happens after, say, setting a New Year’s resolution. But change is a process, not an event. A focus on this process gives individuals the sense that they can make mistakes, learn from them, and still improve their performance over the long run.

▪ In a different analysis, Levy showed that people with fixed negative views on aging die about 7.5 years earlier than those who are more open to a positive future.

▪ When you were twenty-four and you couldn’t find your car keys, you might have thought, “Whoa. Out too late last night.” Or even just, “Too much on my mind.” When you’re fifty and you can’t find your car keys, you may jump to “Uh-oh. Senior moment.” The fact is, fifty-year-olds can simply have too much going on as well. So can eighty-year-olds. Studies show that, on average, seniors have greater life satisfaction and make fewer errors at work relative to their younger counterparts, and that various aspects of thinking and memory actually improve with age. Yet when we have fixed negative assumptions, we tend not to take any of these facts into account.

▪ A malleable sense of self is a cornerstone of emotional agility.

▪ People who have a growth mindset and who see themselves as agents in their own lives are more open to new experiences, more willing to take risks, more persistent, and more resilient in rebounding from failure. They are less likely to mindlessly conform to others’ wishes and values and more likely to be creative and entrepreneurial.

▪ Tweaks that activate one’s sense of self can also have a profound effect, even when the tweak is purely grammatical.

▪ Tweaking your mindset starts with questioning notions about yourself and the world that may seem set in stone—and that might be working against what matters to you—and then making the active choice to turn yourself toward learning, experimentation, growth, and change, one step at a time.

▪ WAGGING FINGER OR WILLING HEART: TWEAKING OUR MOTIVATIONS

▪ Engaging our autonomy—the power of want to rather than have to—is the second prerequisite for tweaking your way to significant change.

▪ When we enter into something this way—compelled by a wagging finger instead of a willing heart—we end up in an internal tug-of-war between good intentions and less-than-stellar execution, even when the end goals—improved health, better relationships with family—are supposedly in line with our values.

▪ Twenty-five hundred years ago, Plato captured this inner conflict with his metaphor of a chariot being pulled by two very different horses. One horse was passion—our internal urges and yearnings—and the other, intellect: our rational, moral mind.

▪ nucleus accumbens

▪ Again, according to brain imaging, when we’re faced with a typical choice, basic attributes like taste are processed on average about 195 milliseconds earlier than health attributes.

▪ Just like Ted, we can position our goals in terms of what we want to do, as opposed to what we have to or should do. When we tweak our motivation in this way, we don’t have to worry about which part of us prevails—our passion or our intellect—because our whole self is working in harmony.

▪ Want-to goals reflect a person’s genuine interest and values (their “why”). We pursue these kinds of goals because of personal enjoyment (intrinsic interest), because of the inherent importance of the goal (identified interest), or because the goal has been assimilated into our core identity (integrated interest).

▪ Have-to goals, on the other hand, are imposed, often by a nagging friend or relative (“You’ve gotta lose that gut!”) or by our own sense of obligation to some internal narrative or external goal, typically related to avoiding shame (“Good grief! I look like the Goodyear blimp! I can’t go to the wedding looking like this!”).

▪ A key difference between these two kinds of reasons is that although have-to motivations will allow you to make positive changes for a while, eventually that determination is going to break down.

▪ Want-to motivation is associated with lower automatic attraction toward the stimuli that are going to trip you up—the old flame, the glimmer of a martini passing by on a waiter’s tray—and instead draws you toward behaviors that can actually help you achieve your goals. Have-to motivation, on the other hand, actually ramps up temptation because it makes you feel constricted or deprived.

▪ One evening my son, Noah, was complaining that he had to do his math homework, even though he actually loves math. This gave me the perfect opportunity for what in parenting parlance they call a teaching moment. “Have to or want to?” I asked. He grinned. “Want to!” he said, and bounded away to do his homework.

▪ If life is a series of small moments, each of which can be adjusted ever so slightly, and all of which, in combination, can add up to significant change, imagine how much ground you could gain by employing this simple tweak and finding the “want to” hidden in the “have to.”

▪ Understanding what we want in the big picture helps us find the desire in circumstances where we otherwise might only see obligation.

▪ For instance, it might be easy for me to say that I “have to” work on yet another beautiful Sunday to finish this book. And if I head to the library to write, I might start to resent the time spent away from my kids or away from the sunshine, and while I might get some work done, I won’t have put my full self into it. However, if I position the work as a “want to” by reminding myself that no one forced me to write a book and that, by doing so, I’m helping spread the important message of emotional agility, my feelings of joy and energy are activated. I’ll become open to new ideas and interpret my editor’s notes as collaboration rather than criticism or commands. And at the end of the day, I’ll likely still be energized enough to enjoy some time with my husband and kids before turning in for the night.

▪ If you can’t find a “want to” in some particular facet of your life, then that could be a sign that change is in order. If you entered your field because you wanted to make a difference in the world but your company is focused more on the bottom line, it may be time to switch jobs. Or if you’ve come to realize that your significant other is not the person you thought he was, you might need to seek a new relationship.

▪ Finding a “want to” is not about forcing any particular choice; it’s about making it easier to choose things that lead to the life you want.

▪ BUILT TO LAST: TWEAKING OUR HABITS

▪ The only way we can really be sure the changes we make are lasting is by taking the intentional behavior we’ve consciously chosen and turning it into that old bugaboo: a habit.

▪ It follows, then, that if we want to direct our behavior toward our values—if we want to reach the master-class level of emotional agility—we should transform our intentional behaviors into habits, making them so deeply ingrained that we no longer have to be “intentional” about them at all.

▪ The beauty of deliberately cultivating habits in line with our values and associated want-to motivations is that they can persist over time with almost no further effort, on good days and on bad, when we’re really paying attention and when we’re not.

▪ In their bestselling book Nudge, the economist Richard Thaler and the law professor Cass Sunstein show how to influence other people’s behavior through carefully designed choices, or what they called “choice architecture.”

▪ Habit is defined as an externally triggered automatic response to a frequently encountered context.

▪ One sign was written in want-to language that appealed to the commuters’ desire for autonomy: “Will You Take the Stairs?” The other sign was written in have-to language that commanded people, “Take the Stairs.”

▪ Limit the exposure, limit the temptation, and you make life easier for the “executive brain,” the part that integrates the cognitive and the emotional to arrive at an appropriate course of action.

▪ 1. The no-brainer: Switch up your environment so that when you’re hungry, tired, stressed, or rushed, the choice most aligned with your values is also the easiest.

▪ Plants and animals are pretty much stuck with the environment they have, but our big brains allow us to act on our environments, instead of merely having them act on us. This provides the opportunity to create the space between the impulse and the action to live the kind of life you truly want to live.

▪ 2. The piggyback: Add a new behavior onto an existing habit.

▪ 3. The precommitment: Anticipate obstacles and prepare for them with “if-then” strategies.

▪ 4. The obstacle course: Offset a positive vision with thoughts of potential challenges.

▪ It’s important to believe that you can achieve your goal, but you also need to pay attention to the obstacles most likely to get in the way. This is called mental contrasting.

▪ Mental contrasting has been shown to help people recover more quickly from chronic back pain, find more satisfaction in relationships, get better grades, and better manage workplace stress.

▪ By imagining the future while clearly assessing the present reality, you link the two to each other. This creates a mental pathway that includes both the obstacles and your plans for getting past them. That path can lead from where you are now to where you want to be.

▪ Tweaking your mindset, motivation, and habits is about turning your heart toward the fluidity of the world, rather than planting your feet on its stability.

▪ It’s setting aside ideas about “what you will become” (results, goals, and outcomes) and engaging freely with the process and journey, taking life moment by moment, habit by habit, and one step at a time.

◆ CHAPTER 8 | MOVING ON

▪ Ideally, the challenges we take on, and the competencies we work to develop, will help move us closer to the life we deeply want.

▪ As we’ve also seen, making habits out of behaviors we’ve consciously chosen, and that are connected with our values, is a key aspect of emotional agility.

▪ By the same token, the opposite of overcompetence, overchallenge, isn’t great either.

▪ Staying emotionally agile requires us to find the equilibrium between overcompetence on the one hand and overchallenge on the other. This is the teeter-totter principle.

▪ On the playground, a teeter-totter, or seesaw, is all about balance.

▪ In life, the teeter-totter principle means finding that give-and-take, that place where competence and the comfort of the familiar exist in a kind of creative tension with the excitement and even the stress of the unknown.

▪ We get to that zone of optimal development in a very specific way: when we live at the edge of our ability, a place in which we’re not overcompetent or complacent, but also not in so far over our heads that we’re overwhelmed.

▪ In our relationships, creative lives, personal development, and work, we can promote this advancement in two ways—expanding our breadth (what we do: the skills we acquire, the topics we talk about, the avenues we explore) and our depth (how well we do what we do: the quality of our listening, our level of engagement with the world).

▪ Remember, this is about building the life you want, not about being busy for busy’s sake, or creating more “should”s for yourself.

▪ So why are we so often left immobilized, with one side of our teeter-totter high and dry and the other side stuck in the mud? The biggest reason is fear.

▪ Just as we’re wired to explore, we’re also wired to keep ourselves safe, and our brains confuse safety with comfort, a comfort that can get us hooked. If something feels comfortable—as in familiar, accessible, and coherent—our brains signal that we’re just fine where we are, thank you very much. And if something feels new, difficult, or even slightly incoherent, fear kicks in.

▪ That “no” has its roots in evolution. At its most basic level—and other than being frozen to the spot in fear—animal behavior consists of two options: approach or avoid.

▪ Studies show that when we make judgments about risk, we show a bias toward the familiar.

▪ Accessibility—the degree to which something is easy to understand—is another proxy in our brains for safety and comfort.

▪ Our bias in favor of the familiar and the accessible can even influence what we accept as the truth: We give more credence to opinions that appear to be widely held.

▪ The curse of comfort—defaulting to the familiar and accessible—wouldn’t matter so much if the only place it led you was down the supermarket aisle, past the unfamiliar and difficult-to-pronounce exotic foods, and straight to your favorite brand of peanut butter.

▪ When we face known risks—a bet, let’s say, with odds that can be calculated—there is increased activity in the reward areas of the brain, especially the striatum. But when we have to place a bet with nothing quantifiable or familiar to go on, our brains show increased activation in the amygdala, an area associated with fear.

▪ Anytime there are gaps in our knowledge, fear fills in those gaps—a fear that overshadows the possibility of a payoff.

▪ THE COHERENCE OF BAD DECISIONS

▪ The fear factor actually increases in subtlety and complexity the more that insecurity and loneliness enter the picture. That’s because humans evolved as a social species that always needed to be part of the family or the pack for survival.

▪ More brain power made us better at judging reliability and trustworthiness beyond kinship, thereby becoming better at creating and maintaining mutually beneficial coalitions that allowed the scrawnier but brainier species (the one that led to us) to outcompete the brawnier but dumber and less cooperative ones (that led to the chimps and gorillas).

▪ The big-brained apes developed an awareness of the passage of time, and of the trajectory of their own lives, and began trying to account not just for their place in the social fabric but also for their place in the universe. They became self-aware, possessed of something called consciousness, and with consciousness came free will, empathy, and a moral sense, even religious awe.

▪ Managing social connection is vital to our survival because we still depend on family and tribe, friends and loved ones, for our well-being. But oddly enough, when push comes to shove, coherence seems to be our top mental and emotional priority.

▪ Mental coherence is what helps me to understand that the sound of the baby crying from the next room is important and deserves my attention, but that the annoying hum of the refrigerator can be tuned out.

▪ Coherence—like familiarity and accessibility—is a crude proxy in our brain for “safe,” even when the desire for coherence leads us to go against our own best interests.

▪ More logically, workers with healthier self-esteem tend to leave their jobs sooner when they don’t get appropriate raises. For these people, it doesn’t make sense not to get the reinforcement they feel they deserve.

▪ How we were treated as children is then used by us as adults to predict how we’ll be seen and received today, as well as how we deserve to be treated, even when it’s derogatory and self-limiting. By the same token, information that challenges these familiar and therefore “coherent” views can feel dangerous and disorienting, even when the disconfirmation shines a new, positive light.

▪ Fear of success, or fear of even being “okay,” can lead to self-sabotage, including underperformance in school, being a slacker, or ruining an otherwise healthy relationship because you haven’t “earned” it.

▪ As if seeking the comfort of coherence wasn’t damaging enough, sometimes it conspires with the even more basic hook of immediate gratification, also known as “comfort now.”

▪ By definition, immediate gratification makes us feel good a lot faster than do the tiny tweaks and disciplined, steady work that can actually get us to higher ground.

▪ Lesson for mice and men (and women): Cheap thrills (and even cozy comforts) can carry high costs.

▪ These self-sabotaging responses are not what we choose to do; they’re what we’ve been conditioned to do, and will continue to do until we unhook from the flight to the familiar and find the agility to shut down the autopilot, show up, step out, and take agency of our own lives. That’s how we’re able to continuously embrace the challenges that allow us to thrive.

▪ In his bestselling book Good to Great, Jim Collins says, “Good is the enemy of great.” I beg to differ. I think avoidance is the enemy of great.

▪ Avoidance—particularly avoidance of discomfort—is even the enemy of good. It’s the enemy of the growth and change that lead to flourishing.

▪ When we say, “I don’t want to fail,” “I don’t want to embarrass myself,” “I don’t want to get hurt,” we’re expressing what I call dead people’s goals. That’s because the only people who never feel discomfort for having made fools of themselves are—you guessed it—dead. The same goes for people who don’t change or mature.

▪ There’s an old adage that if you do what you’ve always done, you’ll get what you’ve always got. But that actually may be too optimistic. Think of the executive who puts in eighty hours a week for twenty years in the same mid-level position at the same company, only to find herself competing for a new job against people half her age after she’s been downsized. Or consider the devoted spouse who spends years faithfully plodding through a monotonous marriage only to come home one day to a half-empty closet in the bedroom and a note on the pillow. To stay truly alive, we need to choose courage over comfort so that we keep growing, climbing, and challenging ourselves, and that means not getting stuck thinking we’ve found heaven when we’re simply sitting on the nearest plateau. But, according to the teeter-totter principle, we also don’t want to be overwhelmed by taking on unrealistic goals, or by thinking we can get to our personal mountaintop in one sudden burst of effort.

▪ Perhaps the best term to describe living at the edge of our ability, thriving and flourishing, being challenged but not overwhelmed, is simply “whelmed.” And a key part of being whelmed lies in being selective in our commitments, which means taking on the challenges that really speak to you and that emerge from an awareness of your deepest values.

▪ On a wintry day in 1637, when Fermat was reading an ancient Greek text called Arithmetica, he scrawled a note in the margin: “It is impossible to separate any power higher than the second into two like powers. I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.”

▪ Then, in 1963, a ten-year-old British schoolboy named Andrew Wiles stumbled on the problem in a book at his local library. Immediately, he vowed to solve it.

▪ When asked why so many people, including himself, had put so much effort into solving what amounted to an abstract mind game, Wiles answered, “Pure mathematicians just love to try unsolved problems—they love a challenge.” In other words, what spurred Wiles on was not the hope of success or glory, but simply a deep intellectual curiosity in the beauty of math.

▪ This is the same kind of curiosity that led our ancient ancestors to leave the rain forest, to explore the grasslands, to discover agriculture and found cities, and eventually to migrate across the globe. It’s why our species is landing rovers on Mars while our genetic cousins, the chimps, are still looking for lunch by digging termites out of mounds with sticks.

▪ Whatever we choose to take on, the trick is to remain whelmed, to get the balance right between challenge and competence.

▪ STAYING WHELMED

▪ Those who broke through the plateau embraced challenge.

▪ They took on new goals and tried to beat new targets with no incentive other than the same joy in personal growth that drives us to learn to tie our shoes, or write a proof for Fermat’s last theorem.

▪ In his book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell popularized the idea that it takes ten thousand hours to burst through a plateau and truly master a skill. The consensus among psychologists and learning specialists, though, is that mastery is not so much a question of the time invested but the quality of the investment.

▪ Quality investment requires “effortful learning,” a form of mindful practice that entails continually tackling challenges that lie just beyond our grasp.

▪ neuroplasticity

▪ The more subtle discovery, however, is that most of those replenished cells die off. What prevents new cell death—and in fact connects the neo-neurons into synapses and integrates them into the brain’s architecture and potential—are effortful learning experiences.

▪ Effortful learning means mindful engagement that continues to expand the boundaries and increase the sophistication of one’s knowledge and experience.

▪ Before you first got behind the wheel, you were unconsciously unskilled in that you didn’t know what you didn’t know.

▪ It’s in that receptiveness to new experience that effortful learning kicks in

▪ When you’re consciously unskilled or consciously skilled, you’re still within the zone of optimal development because you’re open to receiving more knowledge.

▪ Certainly, stress does have its downside. Biochemically speaking, chronic stress can wreak havoc on our systems, fueling inflammation that contributes to heart disease, cancer, and compromised immunity to infections.

▪ But the right amount of stress—whelmed but not overwhelmed—can be a great motivator. As uncomfortable as it feels at times, it’s the stress that keeps us moving forward.

▪ Stress is also pretty much a given if you want to do more in life than flip channels on the remote control. It is a natural and expected complement to challenge, and the learning and flourishing that comes with it.

▪ No one ever got anywhere that mattered without stress and discomfort.

▪ LEAVING THE PLATEAU

▪ CHOOSE COURAGE OVER COMFORT

▪ To keep growing, you need to be open to the unfamiliar, even the uncomfortable. And leaning in to your uncomfortable emotions allows you to learn from them.

▪ CHOOSE WHAT IS WORKABLE

▪ The workable choice is the one that’s appropriate for whatever short-term constraints you face, but that also brings you closer to the life you want to live over time.

▪ Walking out on a marriage doesn’t always make sense. But neither does biting your lip and avoiding difficult conversations, allowing misery and misunderstanding to persist. The courageous solution is also the most workable: Have the uncomfortable conversation and get down to what is real.

▪ KEEP GOING, KEEP GROWING

▪ Flourishing means expanding both the range of what you do and the depth or skill with which you do it.

▪ As for range, ask yourself, “What have I done lately that scares me? When was the last time I tried something and failed?” If you draw a blank, you’re probably playing it too safe.

▪ As for depth, when was the last time you felt vulnerable because you were investing your full passion and really laying it on the line, perhaps in creativity on the job, perhaps in a relationship? Do you truly know the people around you, or do you rely on small talk to limit anything deep and real? If you were going to die this evening, what would you most regret not having said?

▪ GRIT VERSUS QUIT

▪ Even if we choose courage over comfort and engage with life at the edge of our ability, emotional agility is not always a matter of charging full steam ahead, damning all the torpedoes, and tackling your objectives no matter what the cost. If you’re making choices genuinely aligned with your values, there may come a time when the only smart thing to say is “enough is enough.”

▪ Grit embodies—but is not the same as—resilience, ambition, and self-control.

▪ Resilience is about overcoming adversity; ambition, at some level, suggests a desire for wealth, fame, and/or power; self-control can help you resist temptations, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re persistently pursuing a long-term goal.

▪ Teachers who are gritty stay in the profession for longer and are more effective than those who aren’t. Students who are gritty are more likely to graduate. Men who are gritty stay in marriages longer (a finding that, interestingly, doesn’t apply to women).

▪ Emotional agility can help one develop grit, since it allows us to unhook from difficult emotions and thoughts, manage setbacks, and identify our values so we move toward a long-term goal worth pursuing. But it also allows us to let go of those goals once they no longer serve us.

▪ While the passion part of grit is important, it’s healthy only when you are managing the passion, rather than letting it manage you.

▪ You can persevere—working like a dog at a project or task, and possibly even deriving a sense of accomplishment from it—but if all that effort and determination is not in service of your life’s goals, then it’s just not serving you.

▪ For the rest of us, hanging on to unrealistic or harmful goals, often driven by unexamined emotions, is the worst kind of rigidity, leading to all sorts of misery and missed opportunities.

▪ Many people invest years pursuing unsatisfying or unrealistic choices because they’re afraid to admit their error or that their values have evolved, and by the time reality forces them to change course, other ships have sailed.

▪ It may be, alas, that the novel you’ve been laboring on just doesn’t work and needs to be set aside for other pursuits. It may be that even though you got the lead in all your high school musicals, you’re still not Broadway material.

▪ Maybe your ambition wasn’t unrealistic—maybe you’ve just chosen a very tough row to hoe.

▪ Perhaps you actually made it into the ballet company, or got the glamorous job in investment banking you always wanted. But after a while, the thrill has faded, and the life you’re living remains really, really brutal.

▪ Meanwhile, waiting too long to face up to the cold hard facts can cost you plenty as the doors to other opportunities continue to close. Sometimes the truly courageous thing is to say, “I just can’t do this to myself anymore.”

▪ We should be gritty, yes, but not stupid.

▪ The most agile and adaptive response to an unattainable goal is goal adjustment, which entails both disengaging from the unattainable goal and then re-engaging in an alternative.

▪ These are tough, often scary decisions to make, and it’s easy to feel like a quitter if you’re hooked on the idea that grit is a quality to be valued above all others. But there’s no shame—in fact there’s actually a lot of virtue—in making a logical, heartfelt choice.

▪ Instead of looking at these transitions as giving up, look at them as moving on. You’re letting yourself evolve and grow along with your circumstances, choosing a new path that is full of possibility. That decision is filled with grace and dignity.

▪ So, how do you know when to grit or when to quit? How do you act with that grace and dignity?

▪ There are plenty of stories about people who stuck with it, whatever “it” is, and finally broke through, but there are plenty more about people who persevered all the way to a very dead end. So, how do you know whether to adjust your goals and walk away or to give your endeavor one more shot?

▪ In trying to balance the “grit versus quit” equation, the economist Stephen J. Dubner compares two things: the sunk cost and the opportunity cost.

▪ If you can take a step back and stop fretting about sunk costs, you can better assess whether it’s worth investing even more time and money in the same effort.

▪ The real answer to whether you should stick with it or throw in the towel can come only through the self-knowledge that underpins emotional agility. You simply have to show up and step out and move on, discovering and then pursuing your deepest values and goals.

▪ If you’re faced with a grit-or-quit decision, here are some things to ask yourself: Overall, do I find joy or satisfaction in what I’m doing? Does this reflect what is important to me—my values? Does this draw on my strengths? If I’m completely honest with myself, do I believe that I (or this situation) can really be a success? What opportunities will I give up if I persevere with this? Am I being gritty, or am I being stupid?

▪ Emotional agility is about getting on with life. It involves moving toward clear, challenging, yet achievable goals that you pursue not because you think you have to, or because you’ve been told to, but because you want to, because they’re important to you.

▪ When you continue to pursue new knowledge and richer experiences, when you follow your heart and your honest answers to the questions that matter to you, you’ll find that you aren’t stuck on a seesaw. Instead you’ll be soaring, opening up not just your mind but also your world.

◆ CHAPTER 9 | EMOTIONAL AGILITY AT WORK

▪ Erin explained that she had three kids all under the age of five and worked a four-day week to spend more time with them. She’d arranged this plan with her employer, but it didn’t always work as seamlessly as she’d hoped. Just a week earlier, her boss had scheduled an important phone call during her day off, and Erin felt she had no choice but to take it. But because she didn’t want her boss to hear her kids in the background, she’d carried out this super-serious, ninety-minute business discussion . . . while crouched on the floor of her closet.

▪ Erin was trapped, but not just inside her closet.

▪ perfect employee

▪ deeply involved mother

▪ Showing up to her feelings—desperation and resentment at the struggle to balance her life demands and her felt need to be the “perfect employee”—enabled her to gain enough distance from these hooks to step out and see them for what they were (feelings, not fate).

▪ This also allowed her to walk her why in a very open and honest conversation about her boss’s expectations and her own aspirations, during which she made it clear that she treasured the intellectual growth she got from work, but that she also treasured the time she spent with her children.

▪ We now know that fulfillment and flourishing in your personal life do not come from doing what other people say is right for you, but from aligning more of what you do, minute to minute, with your deepest values. The same is true at work.

▪ While it’s customary to accept certain constraints in exchange for a paycheck, employment is not bondage, and employees are not chattel. With practice, you can use the techniques of emotional agility to shape your professional life, rather than having it shape you.

▪ HOOKED AT WORK

▪ The prevailing wisdom of today’s business culture is that uncomfortable thoughts and feelings have no place at the office, and that employees, particularly leaders, should be either stoic or eternally optimistic. They must project confidence and damp down any powerful emotions bubbling up inside them, especially the negative ones. But as we’ve seen, that goes against basic biology. No matter how good they are at what they do, all healthy human beings have an inner stream of thoughts and feelings that include criticism, doubt, and fear. That’s just the human brain doing its job, trying to make sense of the world, anticipate and solve problems, and avoid potential pitfalls.

▪ Work draws on and integrates our hidden beliefs, our self-concepts, our sense of competition and cooperation, and all the life experiences that preceded that first day on the job.

▪ Were we good at fitting in as a kid, or did we feel left out? Did our parents have unrealistic expectations of us? Do we still expect too much of ourselves, or too little? Do we feel confident in our own self-worth and proud of our talents and ideas, or do we try to undermine them?

▪ At work, especially when things get intense, we too often fall back on our old stories about who we believe ourselves to be.

▪ These dusty old narratives can really hook us at critical moments, such as when we get (or need to give) negative feedback, or when we feel pressured to take on more work or to work faster, or when we must deal with supervisors or coworkers with stronger personalities, or when we feel unappreciated, or when our work-life balance is out of whack or—you get the idea. The list goes on.

▪ To advance in our careers, we need to update these narratives the same way we update our résumés.

▪ The business world exists at the bleeding edge of these changes: Globalization, technological innovations, geopolitical instability, regulatory revisions, and demographic shifts make work unpredictable. Role descriptions can change every few months; goals from just last quarter become irrelevant; there are layoffs and consolidations and organizational transformations. It can be a tough-enough battle even without our emotions and thoughts running amok.

▪ We need the resilience to deal with the only constants of each day—ambiguity and change. We also need the interpersonal skills to be able to draw on the power of the group to come up with fresh ideas and perspectives, and to get things done.

▪ We have so much information coming at us, and so many decisions to make, that we can quickly default to the first, best guess, which usually involves black-and-white thinking.

▪ The result of all of this meshugaas is distraction, premature decision making, and simplistic solutions—also known as smart people acting dumb—not to mention stress, emotional strain, panic, guilt, and the false hope that, somehow, technology and multitasking will provide the solution. (They won’t.)

▪ INDIVIDUAL HOOKS

▪ Where Livia slipped up was in letting the hook of insecurity deter her from following through on the deepest value she brought to her work: the desire to contribute.

▪ Even if her slightly paranoid reading of the situation had been correct, the more emotionally agile approach would have been to say, “Okay, I may be on the way out. But damn it, I’ll go out with my head held high, doing work I can be proud of.” Better yet, at the first sign of unease, she could have set up a meeting with her boss in which she opened up and said, “I’m getting a strange vibe. Can you help me understand what’s going on?”

▪ absentee father

▪ He decided that he would conserve all his caring, emotional energy for his home life. At work, he would be all-business, getting on with it and getting things done, so he could go home to the people he loved and who needed him most. As a result, he had no time at the office for small talk or, for that matter, developing relationships of any kind. He saw himself as focused and efficient. But his coworkers saw him as robotic, abrasive, and lacking in empathy.

▪ Because taking care of his family required not just his presence at home. It also required that he commit to and be successful in his career so he could take care of them financially.

▪ There are about as many ways of being hooked at work as there are people in the workforce.

▪ In contrast, emotionally agile managers can step out from their micro-focus. They know that details are important, but they also know how to elevate their thinking and planning from task to objective.

▪ Nowadays, for many of us, the workday is longer, the workplace has become our primary social outlet, and our careers have become inextricably bound to our sense of self. Meanwhile, we’re also bombarded with the message that people can and should find “purpose” in their work. While it is true that work has the potential to enrich our psychological well-being, it’s easier than ever to lose all perspective and sense of proportion.

▪ proclaiming our “expertise,”

▪ overinvolving

▪ To someone who is hooked, “caring less” may sound like slacking off. It’s not. It is actually a form of stepping out and letting go that opens us up to many more dimensions of life, while allowing us to work more effectively in service of the things we truly value.

▪ GROUP HOOKS

▪ Without even realizing it, we make judgments about their weaknesses and strengths, and about how dedicated or talented they are—or are not.

▪ The simple truth is that it’s very easy to get people entirely wrong. Often this is the result of biases we’d never admit to in a million years. Making matters worse, humans are biased about their own objectivity, so we often have no idea that we’re biased in the first place.

▪ “dapper” and the “schnook”

▪ correspondence bias

▪ The Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert assigns four root causes to correspondence bias: 1. WE LACK FULL AWARENESS OF THE SITUATION.

▪ 2. WE HAVE UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS.

▪ 3. WE MAKE EXAGGERATED ASSESSMENTS OF BEHAVIOR.

▪ 4. WE FAIL TO CORRECT OUR INITIAL ASSUMPTIONS.

▪ It’s only when we practice emotional agility that we’re able to shift perspectives and move into continued investigation, discovery, and an evolving understanding of the people and situations we encounter.

▪ HOOKED GROUPS

▪ So in a “can’t ventilate, can’t intubate” life-or-death situation, the cardinal rule is to stop trying to insert a breathing tube and instead find a direct way of getting oxygen into the patient’s airway. This is most often done by making an emergency incision through the neck directly into the windpipe, or trachea.

▪ An otherwise healthy thirty-seven-year-old goes to a modern hospital with experienced staff for a minor procedure and winds up dead? The answer in a word: rigidity. The doctors experienced tunnel vision: a loss of awareness of the situation and a narrowing of context meant that they didn’t take a step back, process what was going on, and shift from Plan A to Plan B.

▪ People can be silent in a constructive way—as when you decide to disengage from an argument that just isn’t that important, or when you refrain from telling a colleague that you think his off-the-cuff idea is absurd. But while the idea that everyone on a team needs to be on the same side is comforting, it all too often leads to group-think fiascos instead of organizational agility.

▪ SHOW UP FOR WORK

▪ To truly show up at the office means making room for and labeling your thoughts and emotions and seeing them for what they are: information rather than facts or directives.

▪ allostatic stress

▪ When you’re in a group environment at work (which is to say, most of the time), in which everyone else is stressed (which is to say, most of the time), everyone adds to everyone else’s allostatic load through another process we described earlier, known as contagion.

▪ Around the average workplace, stress seems to hang in oppressive clouds in the air above everyone’s cubicle. And much like secondhand smoke, secondhand stress can have a profound effect on everyone in its vicinity.

▪ What was astonishing was that this emotional contagion occurred even when the moods doing the influencing had nothing to do with work, and even though the nurses were spending only a few hours of the workday with one another.

▪ Over time, these infectious moods can spread through a given organization, contributing to the overall culture of the workplace.

▪ Another study suggests that even just seeing a stressed-out person can increase the observer’s own stress.

▪ And yes, while stress can be a killer, it turns out that stressing about stress (those Type 2 thoughts from Chapter 3) is the real killer.

▪ At a more existential level, a certain amount of pressure is simply part of living, which makes “getting rid of my stress” one of those dead people’s goals we talked about earlier.

▪ Denying stress, bottling it, or brooding about it is counterproductive.

▪ Avoiding stress is impossible, but what we can do is adjust our relationship to stress. It doesn’t have to own us. We can own it.

▪ The first step is, rather than obsessing about stress as a torment that’s destroying our lives, to simply accept that it exists: to show up to it by acknowledging that it’s not going away anytime soon.

▪ The second, vitally important step is to understand that “stressed” is not who you are.

▪ You may realize that what you’re calling “stress” is actually exhaustion because you’ve taken on too much, or frustration with a team that isn’t pulling together.

▪ THE WHY OF WORK

▪ As we’ve already established, work provides far more than a meal ticket. It can give us a sense of identity and purpose, as well as a framework around which we organize our other activities and interests. Work can also bring substantial mental health benefits. Unless they replace their job with other engaging new activities, retired workers are at risk of accelerated cognitive decline.

▪ What I discovered in my research was that only 4 percent of respondents mentioned their pay as a motivator. Instead, they highlighted their sense of connection with their teams, challenge in their work, being truly seen as individuals, and feeling empowered in their roles.

▪ EMOTIONAL LABOR

▪ Truth is, I needed to show up to my frustration and disaffection and examine what was fueling it: chronic under-challenge. Then I needed to step out from those feelings to develop a broader perspective that would help me to take steps toward what was most constructive. I needed to do my best work, develop all the skills and contacts I could, and use this boring job to help me learn more about what I really wanted to do. Ultimately, instead of using my energy to moan, I needed to put it to better use finding a new job!

▪ At work, though, the more you fake your emotions, or surface act, the worse off you’re likely to be.

▪ Needless to say, as anyone who’s had a bad day at work knows, what happens at work can also seep into your personal life.

▪ surface-acting

▪ Sometimes we get so “busy” we forget to listen to the heartbeat of our why. Without the navigational aid of knowing what truly matters to you, it’s far too easy to spend hours, maybe even years, shuffling papers, surfing the Web, reading pointless emails, yakking in the coffee room, and feeling monstrously unfulfilled. It’s by walking your why at work—taking actions in line with what matters to you—that you become more engaged and are able to perform at the peak of your abilities.

▪ TAKE THIS JOB AND TWEAK IT

▪ So, what do you do when you know your dream job is somewhere up there at the top of the ladder, or out there on the far horizon, but for any number of predictable reasons—money, timing, location, economy—you still need to keep the job you’ve got? You show up to what you’re feeling (“I’m bored”), you step out and create distance from your hooks (“I can’t do better than this”), you examine what is important to you and your want-to motivations (“That said, my coworkers are great”), and then you start tweaking your situation: You take actions that are workable and that will serve you for the long term by bringing you closer to a vital, engaged life.

▪ Tweaking your job, also known as job crafting, involves looking creatively at your work circumstances and finding ways to reconfigure your situation to make it more engaging and fulfilling.

▪ personal resilience

▪ The first step to job crafting is to pay attention to what activities—either at work or outside your job—engage you the most.

▪ When it comes to civilian career building, though, volunteering is an excellent way to change the boundaries of your job.

▪ You can also practice job crafting by changing the nature or extent of your interactions with other people.

▪ You can also change how you see what you do through job crafting.

▪ Job crafting, of course, has its limits. You can’t just stop doing the task you were hired to do while you experiment with different career options.

▪ To get buy-in for your job-crafting ideas, you have to focus on ways to achieve what you want and also create value for the organization. You have to build trust with others as well, especially your supervisor, and then direct your efforts toward the people who are most likely to accommodate you.

▪ By being emotionally agile, we can use the wrong job to gain the perspective, skills, and connections necessary to get to the right job. In the meantime, we can use emotional agility to make the most, every day, of the job we have now. That’s how we ensure that we’re not just making a living, but also truly living.

◆ CHAPTER 10 | RAISING EMOTIONALLY AGILE CHILDREN

▪ Whatever the reason, as capitalism has gone global and the world has become far more competitive, we no longer believe that our children’s success can be left to chance.

▪ In an economy in which the top 1 percent can afford luxury beyond belief, the bottom 20 percent can barely afford to eat, and those in the middle have to scramble like crabs in a barrel, modern parents have taken a more curatorial approach toward childhood, with each very deliberate decision directed toward getting their offspring into the best college they can, and ultimately into the kind of career that might possibly allow their kids to have a decent life.

▪ At the same time, our collective focus on self-esteem has expanded. It’s a well-meaning reaction to colder, more authoritarian parenting styles of the past, which had plenty of psychologically damaging side effects. But in our attempts to raise our children to be more capable and confident, we’re now hyper-attuned to shielding them from any adverse experiences that we worry may shatter their psyches.

▪ acknowledge the effort not the result

▪ Unfortunately, these efforts underestimate a child’s ability to learn and grow from experience, and can have a host of unintended consequences, often the exact opposite of what we had hoped to achieve.

▪ In her book How to Raise an Adult, Julie Lythcott-Haims, a former associate vice provost at Stanford University, calls these young people “existentially impotent.”

▪ Another unintended consequence of overparenting is that kids can grow up thinking that their parents’ love is conditional on their behaving a certain way. This leads to contingent self-esteem, the belief that their worth must be earned.

▪ Even parents who would never go so far as to hover or micromanage still want their children to live healthy, productive, successful lives—which makes it hard for any parent, especially when the road gets a bit bumpy, not to intervene and push a child down the path they see as best.

▪ No matter how hard you try to ensure that your kids are successful, happy, and safe, though, you can be sure that temptations will arise and that change is inevitable.

▪ Emotional agility is like a vaccine that helps inoculate kids against being overwhelmed by the moments of unpleasantness that life no doubt has in store for them. It won’t give kids complete immunity, but it will help them develop the flexibility and resilience they need to flourish, even during hard times.

▪ TAKING THE PLUNGE

▪ autopilot response

▪ Life is full of diving boards and other precipices, but, as we’ve seen throughout this discussion of emotional agility, making the leap is not about ignoring, fixing, fighting, or controlling fear—or anything else you might be experiencing. Rather, it’s about accepting and noticing all your emotions and thoughts, viewing even the most powerful of them with compassion and curiosity, and then choosing courage over comfort in order to do whatever you’ve determined is most important to you.

▪ Courage, once again, is not the absence of fear. Courage is fear walking—or in Noah’s case, fear diving.

▪ We want our children to thrive, and since we can so often see the way forward for them, we try to push them in that direction, assuming that, by doing so, our children will realize that whatever they were reluctant about really wasn’t so bad.

▪ Instead, I was able to start a conversation with Noah that we continued later at home. After he acknowledged that he was scared, we talked about how he might feel if he did jump (thrilled and proud); how he might feel if he didn’t jump (relieved on some level but disappointed in himself); and critically, how he could go ahead in spite of his fears and jump anyway, because it was important to him.

▪ That is, I first encouraged him to show up to his fear: Evolution has made us wary of heights for a reason, and there’s no shame in needing time to adjust to the counterintuitive notion that a one-meter leap into four meters of chlorinated water is a reasonable thing to do.

▪ Simply acknowledging what he was feeling changed Noah’s relationship with his fear, allowing him to then step out—to create a dispassionate distance between the emotion and what he wanted to accomplish. This meant distancing himself from both the physical effects of his fear—the cortisol surge, the accelerated heart rate, and the hyperventilation—and from any self-doubting narratives that might have already hooked him at his tender age.

▪ From there we examined his why, or the reasons he genuinely wanted to jump off the high dive: fun, thrills, camaraderie. Along the way, I tried to assure him that the choice to jump or not to jump was entirely his. In spite of any peer pressure he might have been subjected to, the high dive was certainly not a have-to, but it could be a want-to.

▪ When we guide our children through these basic steps toward emotional agility, we give them a lifelong tool. Every time they take a leap—not of recklessness or blind faith, but of eyes-wide-open volition in spite of fear—they practice fear walking, a skill that will help them face many other, much more significant emotional challenges later in life.

▪ LEADING BY EXAMPLE

▪ To be truly happy, though, one must know simply how to “be,” and by that I mean to be effectively with oneself—centered, kind, curious, and not fragile—in a changing world.

▪ We all know that love and structure help prepare a child for caring relationships and a successful career, but emotional agility offers a skill set that can translate love and structure into lifelong well-being. For parents, emotional agility provides a skill set for helping their child learn to thrive.

▪ Many of the studies that document the value of helping kids learn the skills to show up, step out, walk their why, and move on have been carried out over long-enough periods of time to trace the development of resilience, morality, willpower, health, psychological stability, and relationship success well into adulthood. Happily, some of these conclusions have started to make their way into popular culture. A notable example is the animated movie Inside Out, which explores a girl’s varied and changing emotions and shows how even the difficult emotions, like sadness, play an important role in shaping who we are.

▪ For parents, the most effective way to teach your children emotional agility is by practicing it yourself.

▪ “No, it’s not okay. But it will be okay.”

▪ I was dismissing Noah’s very clear and immediate, albeit pre-verbal, feelings, denying the very painful reality of his experience. In essence, I was telling him to bottle it!

▪ SEEING YOU, SEEING ME

▪ However, while responding in these ways may solve the immediate problem, it deprives the child of the critically important opportunity to sit with her difficult feelings—to show up, step out, and learn from those sometimes heartbreaking real-world situations. They also inadvertently signal to the child “I don’t trust your ability to problem-solve.”

▪ On the other hand, when you take the time to let your child acknowledge her feelings and reassure her that these emotions are normal and healthy, you go a long way in helping your child develop the tools she will need to grow into a productive, emotionally agile adult.

▪ By simply letting our children know that we see them in full, clearly and without judgment, we signal that we accept and validate their emotional experience.

▪ So despite our urge to fix things, to make everything better as quickly as possible, we’re better off simply pausing and listening, showing our children by example how to create that space between stimulus and response.

▪ When a child feels fully seen and acknowledged by those around him, it’s hard for him not to feel loved and secure.

▪ Secure attachment is the stabilizer of a child’s emotional life right on into middle school and adolescence, and on to the formation of his or her adult relationships.

▪ A child’s sense of secure attachment—this idea that I, in all my glory, as well as all my stinkiness and imperfection, am loved and accepted—allows him not only to take risks in the world but also to take risks with his own emotions.

▪ To be clear, while raising emotionally agile children requires that you acknowledge and accept their feelings without rebuke, it does not mean you need to tolerate tantrums or irrational behavior.

▪ By helping your child learn to label the emotion, gain perspective, and put distance between the impulse and the action, you’re reinforcing the idea that, while they don’t need to restrain their feelings, they do sometimes need to restrain their behavior.

▪ HOW TO THINK, NOT WHAT TO THINK

▪ To her immense credit, my mother didn’t try to minimize my upset (which might have taught me to bottle), nor did she try to make everything right by placating me. Instead, she allowed me to live with what I was feeling and even let me exercise my own free will, however misguided it was. All the while, though, she maintained her (invisible) tether of protection and attachment by making sure I was safe, and she was ready to intervene in case of a threat. In other words, she kept me physically safe but gave me the gift of emotional autonomy.

▪ Autonomy is a bedrock element of lifelong thriving and is critical to children’s moral development. Autonomy means self-governance, or rule by the self, and in psychological terms, an autonomous person lives according to the choices he or she makes.

▪ Truly autonomous actions are those you fully own and endorse with your deepest self, without coercion from either the outside or your own unchecked impulses.

▪ Here’s how we can encourage autonomy in a child: Honor him for who he actually is (e.g., someone who loves drawing) rather than who you wish him to be (e.g., someone who loves wrestling).

▪ Give her a true choice wherever possible—which is not the same as not setting limits, or not establishing expectations, or indulging her every whim.

▪ Provide a rationale for the decisions you make when no choice is possible.

▪ Minimize external rewards, such as stickers, toys, or cash, for doing things like peeing in the potty instead of a diaper, or doing homework, or getting good grades.

▪ Children raised in a barter-or-bribe economy, just like those raised in a command-and-control environment, don’t develop the strong autonomous self that can create distance between real desires and preprogrammed responses—and it makes no difference whether the responses are rebellious or compliant. And people taught to act in the expectation of extrinsic rewards turn out to be less happy, less successful, and have less satisfying relationships than those who are internally motivated.

▪ Encouraging autonomy also helps kids to develop—a “why” to walk—a set of values that is their own, separate from rewards and requirements.

▪ Only when kids are properly guided toward learning and trusting their own values can they discover their whys and want-to motivations—the ones that lead to genuine thriving.

▪ RAISING CHILDREN WHO CARE

▪ Parenting with emotional agility is not just about expressing empathy for your child in the moment; it’s about modeling empathetic behavior regularly so your children can learn to do the same.

▪ empathy and perspective taking cannot be instilled by fiat

▪ In other words, the children who’d been given a free choice all along were more generous than those who’d been coerced.

▪ Forcing your son to invite a lonely classmate to his birthday party or threatening to punish your daughter if she doesn’t apologize for an insensitive comment on the playground may get you a quick result and a temporary feeling of relief. But only by letting your children act autonomously, encouraging them to dig deep to discover their genuine want-to motivations, can you help them unlock their own potential for empathy.

▪ Kids were more likely to understand the benefits of telling the truth and the costs of lying if they agreed with these statements: “When my parent asked me to do something, he/she explained why he/she wanted me to do it,” “My parent gave me many opportunities to make my own decisions about what I do,” and “My parent was open to my thoughts and feelings even when they were different from his/hers.”

▪ The virtues of promoting autonomy can also be viewed from a purely practical perspective: You won’t always be there with your adult child, holding his or her hand every step of the way and helping him or her navigate every ethical quandary and choice—at least I hope not! Nor will you be there to help your kids step out and unhook every time they’re confronted with a powerful emotion or an impulsive thought.

▪ They spoke of how disappointed they were with my behavior and told me that stealing and lying were not things we did in our family. Then they helped me figure out how I could make it right, including paying them back and apologizing to the friend that I’d pulled into the mess.

▪ Instead, they were clear, calm, and, I think, conscious of what they wanted to achieve. By helping me understand the emotional impact on them and on my friend, and not simply lecturing me about how what I’d done was wrong, they allowed me to gain some perspective on my actions rather than adopting a defensive stance (a behavior that often leads to more lying). They stated expectations rather than doling out a punishment.

▪ The truth was that I felt isolated at school, and this loneliness was amplified whenever the gaggle of girls I most liked headed off together at recess to buy candy—which I didn’t often have the money to do. Because my parents helped me face this discomfort, I was able to have a conversation with them not only about taking ownership of my behavior but also about the strategies I might use to get to know some of my classmates better, and to feel more a part of the fun—without stealing. I also learned how to have a difficult discussion that yields a productive end, which is no small thing.

▪ By steering clear of this possibility, my parents kept the incident in its rightful place—as something that had happened once and an opportunity to learn. They met me where I was, not where they wanted me to be, and that made all the difference.

▪ EMOTIONAL COACHING

▪ Moving on is best achieved by encouraging your children to brainstorm. When you support them to find solutions on their own—solutions that are meaningful to them—they develop the autonomy that will help them navigate their world, as well as the sense of responsibility that comes with it.

▪ tiny tweaks: small changes that help your child take on challenges and move toward what is important

▪ The key focus here is on the process—being open to experimentation, to giving things a try, and discovering what might be learned—rather than some ideal, pass-or-fail outcome.

▪ Often when we demand that weepy or angry kids behave in more socially acceptable ways, we inadvertently send them the message that their feelings don’t matter to us.

▪ Jon tells me that now, many years later, he still reminds his son that it’s possible to cry and play at the same time.

▪ THAT’S ALL

▪ As Malala recovered from her wounds, her mother and father discovered that their courage in how they had raised their daughter was to their benefit as well.

▪ “What has made Malala so special and so bold and so poised? Don’t ask me what I did. Ask me what I did not do. I did not clip her wings, and that’s all.”

◆ CHAPTER 11 | CONCLUSION: BECOMING REAL

▪ “Real isn’t how you are made,” says the Skin Horse. “It’s a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.”

▪ emotional agility allows us to be our authentic selves for everyone, every day.

▪ Emotional agility is the absence of pretense and performance, which gives your actions greater power because they emanate from your core values and core strength, something solid and genuine and real.

▪ Here’s how you can start this journey today:

▪ Appoint yourself the agent of your own life and take ownership of your own development, career, creative spirit, work, and connections.

▪ Accept your full self—rubbed-off nose, shabby ears, “good” and “bad” emotions, the whole package—with compassion, courage, and curiosity.

▪ Welcome your inner experiences, breathe into them, and learn their contours without racing for the exit.

▪ Embrace an evolving identity and release narratives that no longer serve you.

▪ Let go of unrealistic dead people’s goals by accepting that being alive means sometimes getting hurt, failing, being stressed, and making mistakes.

▪ Free yourself from pursuing perfection so you can enjoy the process of loving and living.

▪ Open yourself up to the love that will come with hurt and the hurt that will come with love; and to the success that will come with failure and the failure that will come with success.

▪ Abandon the idea of being fearless, and instead walk directly into your fears, with your values as your guide, toward what matters to you. Courage is not an absence of fear; courage is fear walking.

▪ Choose courage over comfort by vitally engaging with new opportunities to learn and grow, rather than passively resigning yourself to your circumstances.

▪ Recognize that life’s beauty is inseparable from its fragility.

▪ We’re young, until we’re not. We’re healthy, until we’re not. We’re with those we love, until we’re not.

▪ Learn how to hear the heartbeat of your own why.

▪ And finally, remember to “dance if you can.”
